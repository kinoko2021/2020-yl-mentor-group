Supported FreeIPA Versions

FreeIPA versions 4.6 and up are supported by all roles.

The client role supports versions 4.4 and up, the server role is working with
versions 4.5 and up, the replica role is currently only working with versions
4.6 and up.

Supported Distributions

- RHEL/CentOS 7.4+
- Fedora 26+
- Ubuntu
- Debian 10+ (ipaclient only, no server or replica!)

Requirements

  Controller
  - Ansible version: 2.8+ (ansible-freeipa is an Ansible Collection)
  - /usr/bin/kinit is required on the controller if a one time password (OTP)
    is used

  Node
  - Supported FreeIPA version (see above)
  - Supported distribution (needed for package installation only, see above)

Limitations

External signed CA is now supported. But the currently needed two step process
is an issue for the processing in a simple playbook.
Work is planned to have a new method to handle CSR for external signed CAs in
a separate step before starting the server installation.",工具,有server/client关键字，安装内容以脚本居多，放工具

redhat.rhel_metrics.bpftrace
A role that extends the core PCP role, providing metrics from bpftrace
scripts using Linux eBPF facilities.  Configuring authentication of a
local user capable of running bpftrace scripts via the PCP agent is a
key task of this role.

'hivexregedit' (in perl-hivex) lets you export and merge to the
textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.
