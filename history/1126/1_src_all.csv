shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an

a user's environment via modulefiles.

Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,

programs. These include MAD, SA, SMP, and other basic IB functions.
librdmacm provides a userspace RDMA Communication Management API.
In conjunction with the kernel ib_srp driver, srp_daemon allows you to
discover and use SCSI devices via the SCSI RDMA Protocol over InfiniBand.
Useful libibverbs example programs such as ibv_devinfo, which
displays information about RDMA devices.
iwpmd provides a userspace service for iWarp drivers to claim
tcp ports through the standard socket interface.
RDMA core userspace infrastructure and documentation, including kernel
driver-specific modprobe override configs, IPoIB network scripts,
dracut rules, and the rdma-ndd utility.
libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
""verbs"" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  This includes direct hardware
access from userspace to InfiniBand/iWARP adapters (kernel bypass) for
fast path operations.

Device-specific plug-in ibverbs userspace drivers are included:

- libbxnt_re: Broadcom NetXtreme-E RoCE HCA
- libcxgb4: Chelsio T4 iWARP HCA
- libefa: Amazon Elastic Fabric Adapter
- libhfi1: Intel Omni-Path HFI
- libhns: HiSilicon Hip06 SoC
- libirdma: Intel Ethernet Connection RDMA
- libmlx4: Mellanox ConnectX-3 InfiniBand HCA
- libmlx5: Mellanox Connect-IB/X-4+ InfiniBand HCA
- libqedr: QLogic QL4xxx RoCE HCA
- librxe: A software implementation of the RoCE protocol
- libsiw: A software implementation of the iWarp protocol
- libvmw_pvrdma: VMware paravirtual RDMA device
libibumad provides the userspace management datagram (umad) library
functions, which sit on top of the umad modules in the kernel. These
are used by the IB diagnostic and management tools, including OpenSM.
Example test programs for the librdmacm library.
Pyverbs is a Cython-based Python API over libibverbs, providing an
easy, object-oriented access to IB verbs.
The ibacm daemon helps reduce the load of managing path record lookups on
large InfiniBand fabrics by providing a user space implementation of what
is functionally similar to an ARP cache.  The use of ibacm, when properly
configured, can reduce the SA packet load of a large IB cluster from O(n^2)
to O(n).  The ibacm daemon is started and normally runs in the background,
user applications need not know about this daemon as long as their app
uses librdmacm to handle connection bring up/tear down.  The librdmacm
library knows how to talk directly to the ibacm daemon to retrieve data.

conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must

for built-in operations (for example, LC_CTYPE for regular expressions,
LC_COLLATE for string comparison, and LC_NUMERIC for number formatting). Each
""use locale"" or ""no locale"" affects statements to the end of the enclosing
block.
ODBM_File establishes a connection between a Perl hash variable and a file in
odbm format. You can manipulate the data in the file just as if it were in
a Perl hash, but when your program exits, the data will remain in the file, to
be used the next time your program runs.
The ""B"" module supplies classes which allow a Perl program to delve into its
own innards. It is the module used to implement the backends of the Perl
compiler.
The ""mro"" name space provides several utilities for dealing with method
resolution order and method caching in general.
This package allows a tied hash to load its values automatically on the first
access, and to use the cached value on the following accesses.
The default behavior of file test operators (e.g. ""-r"") is to use the simple
mode bits as returned by the stat() family of system calls. However, many
operating systems have additional features to define more complex access
rights, for example ACLs (Access Control Lists). For such environments, ""use
filetest"" may help the permission operators to return results more consistent
with other tools.
""use less ...;"" is a Perl user-pragma. If you're very lucky some code you're
using will know that you asked for less CPU usage or RAM or fat or... we just
can't know.
The Getopt::Std module provides functions for processing single-character
switches with switch clustering. Pass one argument which is a string
containing all switches to be recognized.
The diagnostics module extends the terse diagnostics normally emitted by both
the perl compiler and the perl interpreter (from running perl with a -w switch
or ""use warnings""), augmenting them with the more explicative and endearing
descriptions found in perldiag. splain tool explains perl messages found on
standard input.
This is an object-oriented interface for opening files and performing
input/output operations on them.
As of Perl 5.26.0, this module has no effect. The internal Perl feature that
was used to implement this module has been removed.  Hence, if you load this
module on Perl 5.26.0, you will get one warning that the module is no longer
supported; and the module will do nothing thereafter.
""deprecate"" pragma simplifies the maintenance of dual-life modules that will no
longer be included in the Perl core in a future Perl release, but are
still included currently. The purpose of the pragma is to alert users to the
status of such a module by issuing a warning that encourages them to install
the module from CPAN, so that a future upgrade to a perl which omits the
module will not break their code.
The ""vmsish"" pragma control VMS-specific features of the Perl language. If
you're not running VMS, this module does nothing.
A ""SelectSaver"" object contains a reference to the file handle that was
selected when it was created. When the object is destroyed, it re-selects the
file handle that was selected when it was created.
A File::Copy module provides two basic functions, copy and move, which are
useful for getting the contents of a file from one place to another.
This Thread module served as the front end to the old-style thread model,
called 5005threads, that has been removed in version 5.10.

For old code and interim backwards compatibility, the Thread module has been
reworked to function as a front end for the new interpreter threads (ithreads)
model. However, some previous functionality is not available. Further, the
data sharing models between the two thread models are completely different,
and anything to do with data sharing has to be thought differently.

You are strongly encouraged to migrate any existing threaded code to the new
model (i.e., use the threads and threads::shared modules) as soon as possible.
Memoizing a function makes it faster by trading space for time. It does
this by caching the return values of the function in a table. If you call
the function again with the same arguments, memoize jumps in and gives
you the value out of the table, instead of letting the function compute
the value all over again.
Class::Struct module exports a single function struct(). Given a list of
element names and types, and optionally a class name, struct() creates a
Perl 5 class that implements a struct-like data structure.
These are Perl modules that helps connecting classes with arrays, hashes,
handles, and scalars.
If a module is not loaded yet, then the autouse declaration declares functions
in the current package. When these functions are called, they load the package
and substitute themselves with the correct definitions.
The ""cacheout"" function will make sure that there's a file handle open
for reading or writing available as the path name you give it. It
automatically closes and re-opens files if you exceed your system
maximum number of file descriptors, or the suggested maximum.
Several utilities which come with Perl distribution like h2ph, perlbug,
perlthanks, and pl2pm. Some utilities are provided by more specific
packages like perldoc by perl-Pod-Perldoc and splain by perl-diagnostics.
It attempts several methods of getting the system hostname and then caches the
result.
The Config::Extensions module provides a hash %Extensions containing all the
core extensions that were enabled for this perl.
This Perl module tells its users that functions in a package are to be
autoloaded from after the ""__DATA__"" token. See also ""Autoloading"" in
perlsub.
GDBM_File is a module which allows Perl programs to make use of the facilities
provided by the GNU gdbm library.
Overloading pragma allows you to lexically disable or enable overloading.
Contemporary Perl still refers to some Perl header (ph) files although it does
not build them anymore. This is a prebuilt collection of the referred files.
If you miss other ones, you can generate them with h2ph tool from perl-utils
package.
This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default, Perl
limits itself to real numbers, but an extra ""use"" statement brings full
complex support, along with a full set of mathematical functions typically
associated with and/or extended to complex numbers.
This is the perl debugger. It is loaded automatically by Perl when you invoke
a script with ""perl -d"". There is also ""DB"" module contained for
a programmatic interface to the debugging API.
This package converts files from POD format (see perlpod) to HTML format. It
can automatically generate indexes and cross-references, and it keeps a cache
of things it knows how to cross-reference.
""base"" module allows you to both load one or more modules, while setting up
inheritance from those modules at the same time.  Unless you are using the
""fields"" pragma, consider this module discouraged in favor of the
lighter-weight ""parent"".
The ""fields"" pragma enables compile-time and run-time verified class fields.
This package provides an object-oriented interface to Perl build-in getgr*()
and getpw*() functions.
This module provides an interface that allows filters to be applied to tied
hashes associated with DBM files.
The libnetcfg utility can be used to configure the libnet.
IO::Zlib provides an IO:: style interface to Compress::Zlib and hence to
gzip/zlib-compressed files. It provides many of the same methods as the
IO::Handle interface.
Devel::Peek contains functions which allows raw Perl data types to be
manipulated from a Perl script. This is used by those who do XS programming to
check that the data they are sending from C to Perl looks as they think it
should look.
""Errno"" defines and conditionally exports all the error constants defined in
your system ""errno.h"" include file. It has a single export tag, "":POSIX"",
which will export all POSIX defined error numbers.
Returns a copy of the input string with the nonprintable characters below
0x100 changed into printables. Any ASCII printables or above 0xFF are
unchanged.
This module simplifies the manipulation of @INC at compile time.
Fcntl module provides file operation related options.
The POSIX module permits you to access all (or nearly all) the standard POSIX
1003.1 identifiers. Many of these identifiers have been given Perl interfaces.
Tie::File represents a regular text file as a Perl array. Each element in the
array corresponds to a record in the file. The first line of the file is
element 0 of the array; the second line is element 1, and so on.  The file is
not loaded into memory, so this will work even for gigantic files.  Changes to
the array are reflected in the file immediately.
This module enumerates the Perl functions that are documented in perlfunc POD.
ExtUtils::Constant facilitates generating C and XS wrapper code to allow
Perl modules to AUTOLOAD constants defined in C library header files.
The ""open"" pragma serves as one of the interfaces to declare default ""layers""
(also known as ""disciplines"") for all I/O.
This package provides an object-oriented interface to Perl built-in gmtime()
and localtime () functions.
This Perl module implements DOS-like globbing with a few enhancements. It
is largely compatible with perlglob.exe in all but one respect--it understands
wild cards in directory components.
This is a collection of Perl input/output modules.
The Benchmark module encapsulates a number of routines to help you figure out
how long it takes to execute some code.
The Time::Piece module replaces the standard localtime and gmtime functions
with implementations that return objects.  It does so in a backwards compatible
manner, so that using localtime or gmtime as documented in perlfunc still
behave as expected.
This module looks for MakeMaker-like ""blib"" directory structure starting in
given or current directory and working back up to five levels of directories.
It is intended for use on command line with -M option as a way of testing
arbitrary scripts against an uninstalled version of a package.
NDBM_File establishes a connection between a Perl hash variable and a file in
ndbm format. You can manipulate the data in the file just as if it were in
a Perl hash, but when your program exits, the data will remain in the file, to
be used the next time your program runs.
The langinfo() function queries various locale information that can be used to
localize output and user interfaces. It uses the current underlying locale,
regardless of whether or not it was called from within the scope of ""use
locale"".
Dumpvalue module enables you to print a content of variables and other Perl
data structures.
Hash::Util::FieldHash offers a number of functions in support of the
inside-out technique of class construction.
When testing applications, often you find yourself needing to provide
functionality in your test environment that would usually be provided by
external modules. Rather than munging the %INC by hand to mark these external
modules as loaded, so they are not attempted to be loaded by perl, this module
offers you a very simple way to mark modules as loaded and/or unloaded.
This package is just a front end to some other packages. It's a stub to
set up a common interface to the various read-line implementations found
on CPAN (under the ""Term::ReadLine::*"" name space).
This module sets file position in a file handle to be first line greater than
or equal (string-wise) to a key.
With the ""sort"" pragma you can control the behavior of the builtin ""sort()""
function.
Semaphores provide a mechanism to regulate access to resources. Unlike locks,
semaphores aren't tied to particular scalars, and so may be used to control
access to anything you care to use them for. Semaphores don't limit their
values to zero and one, so they can be used to control access to some resource
that there may be more than one of (e.g., file handles). Increment and
decrement amounts aren't fixed at one either, so threads can reserve or return
multiple resources at once.
This will predeclare all the subroutines whose names are in the list,
allowing you to use them without parentheses (as list operators) even
before they're declared.
It stores all unambiguous truncations of each element of a list as keys in
an associative array. The values are the original list elements.
This module overrides the core stat() and lstat() functions, replacing them
with versions that return File::stat objects. This object has methods that
return the similarly named structure field name from the stat(2) function.
The Opcode module allows you to define an operator mask to be in effect when
perl next compiles any code. Attempting to compile code which contains
a masked opcode will cause the compilation to fail with an error. The code
will not be executed.
The Symbol module provides functions for manipulating Perl symbols.
These are functions that spawn a given command and connects the standard
output of the command for reading, standard output for writing, and standard
error output for handling the errors.
The DynaLoader module defines a standard generic interface to the dynamic
linking mechanisms available on many platforms. Its primary purpose is to
implement automatic dynamic loading of Perl modules. For a simpler interface,
see XSLoader module.
Devel::SelfStubber prints the stubs you need to put in the module before the
__DATA__ token (or you can get it to print the entire module with stubs
correctly placed). The stubs ensure that if a method is called, it will get
loaded. They are needed specifically for inherited autoloaded methods.
This module is a simple wrapper around Locale::Maketext::Lexicon, designed
to alleviate the need of creating Language Classes for module authors.
The NEXT module adds a pseudo-class named ""NEXT"" to any program that uses it.
If a method ""m"" calls ""$self->NEXT::m()"", the call to ""m"" is redispatched as
if the calling method had not originally been found.
Hash::Util contains special functions for manipulating hashes that don't
really warrant a keyword.
A File::Compare Perl module provides functions for comparing a content of two
files specified by a file name or a file handle.
The ""if"" module is used to conditionally load another module.
Perl is a high-level programming language with roots in C, sed, awk and shell
scripting. Perl is good at handling processes and files, and is especially
good at handling text. Perl's hallmarks are practicality and efficiency.
While it is used to do a lot of different things, Perl's most common
applications are system administration utilities and web programming.

This is a metapackage with all the Perl bits and core modules that can be
found in the upstream tarball from perl.org.

If you need only a specific feature, you can install a specific package
instead. E.g. to handle Perl scripts with /usr/bin/perl interpreter,
install perl-interpreter package. See perl-interpreter description for more
details on the Perl decomposition into packages.
The sigtrap pragma is a simple interface for installing signal handlers.
The AutoLoader module works with the AutoSplit module and the ""__END__"" token
to defer the loading of some subroutines until they are used rather than
loading them all at once.
Utilities for embedding Perl in C/C++ applications.
There is no reason to use this module nowadays. The DirHandle module provides
an alternative interface to the opendir(), closedir(), readdir(), and
rewinddir() functions. Since Perl 5.6, opendir() alone has been all you need
for lexical handles.
The Safe extension module allows the creation of compartments in which Perl
code can be evaluated. Please note that the restriction is not suitable for
security purposes.
The Unicode::UCD module offers a series of functions that provide a simple
interface to the Unicode Character Database.
This module provides the ability to use references as hash keys if you first
""tie"" the hash variable to this module. Normally, only the keys of the tied
hash itself are preserved as references; to use references as keys in
hashes-of-hashes, use Tie::RefHash::Nestable, included as part of
Tie::RefHash.

virt-what,,,"virt-what is a shell script which can be used to detect if the program
is running in a virtual machine.

The program prints out a list of ""facts"" about the virtual machine,
derived from heuristics.  One fact is printed per line.

If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error),
then it can mean either that the program is running on bare-metal or
the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we don't
know about or can't detect.

cyrus-imapd,"The cyrus-imapd-utils package contains administrative tools for the
Cyrus IMAP server. It can be installed on systems other than the
one running the server.
The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to
personal mail, system-wide bulletin boards, news-feeds, calendar and contacts
through the IMAP, JMAP, NNTP, CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The Cyrus IMAP
server is a scalable enterprise groupware system designed for use from small to
large enterprise environments using technologies based on well-established Open
Standards.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

doing a feature by feature comparison, we will simply list the features
of the server, and let you decide if they satisfy your needs.

Support for RFC and VSA Attributes Additional server configuration
attributes Selecting a particular configuration Authentication methods
The FreeRADIUS Server Project is a high performance and highly configurable
GPL'd free RADIUS server. The server is similar in some respects to
Livingston's 2.0 server.  While FreeRADIUS started as a variant of the
Cistron RADIUS server, they don't share a lot in common any more. It now has
many more features than Cistron or Livingston, and is much more configurable.

FreeRADIUS is an Internet authentication daemon, which implements the RADIUS
protocol, as defined in RFC 2865 (and others). It allows Network Access
Servers (NAS boxes) to perform authentication for dial-up users. There are
also RADIUS clients available for Web servers, firewalls, Unix logins, and
more.  Using RADIUS allows authentication and authorization for a network to
be centralized, and minimizes the amount of re-configuration which has to be
done when adding or deleting new users.

GPL'd free RADIUS server. The server is similar in some respects to
Livingston's 2.0 server.  While FreeRADIUS started as a variant of the
Cistron RADIUS server, they don't share a lot in common any more. It now has
many more features than Cistron or Livingston, and is much more configurable.

FreeRADIUS is an Internet authentication daemon, which implements the RADIUS
protocol, as defined in RFC 2865 (and others). It allows Network Access
Servers (NAS boxes) to perform authentication for dial-up users. There are
also RADIUS clients available for Web servers, firewalls, Unix logins, and
more.  Using RADIUS allows authentication and authorization for a network to
be centralized, and minimizes the amount of re-configuration which has to be
done when adding or deleting new users.",High-performance and highly configurable free RADIUS server,"python3-freeradius

Guice is a lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 5
and above. This package provides Bill of Materials module for Guice.
Put simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new
in your Java code. Think of Guice's @Inject as the new new. You will
still need to write factories in some cases, but your code will not
depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test
and reuse in other contexts.

Guice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to
features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You
might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework.

Javassist enables Java programs to define a new class at runtime and to
modify a class file when the JVM loads it. Unlike other similar
bytecode editors, Javassist provides two levels of API: source level
and bytecode level. If the users use the source-level API, they can
edit a class file without knowledge of the specifications of the Java
bytecode. The whole API is designed with only the vocabulary of the
Java language. You can even specify inserted bytecode in the form of
source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly. On the other hand, the
bytecode-level API allows the users to directly edit a class file as
other editors.

lato-fonts,,,"Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer Łukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says Łukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics.

LZ4 compression for Java, based on Yann Collet's work.
This library provides access to two compression methods
that both generate a valid LZ4 stream:

* fast scan (LZ4):
    ° low memory footprint (~ 16 KB),
    ° very fast (fast scan with skipping heuristics in case the
      input looks incompressible),
    ° reasonable compression ratio (depending on the
      redundancy of the input).
* high compression (LZ4 HC):
    ° medium memory footprint (~ 256 KB),
    ° rather slow (~ 10 times slower than LZ4),
    ° good compression ratio (depending on the size and
      the redundancy of the input).

The streams produced by those 2 compression algorithms use the
same compression format, are very fast to decompress and can be
decompressed by the same decompressor instance.

Ncat is a feature packed networking utility which will read and
write data across a network from the command line.  It uses both
TCP and UDP for communication and is designed to be a reliable
back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other
applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6
but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential
uses.

Certificate Authority (CA), the KRA stores private encryption keys as part of
the certificate enrollment process.  The key archival mechanism is triggered
when a user enrolls in the PKI and creates the certificate request.  Using the
Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request format, a request is
generated for the user's private encryption key.  This key is then stored in
the KRA which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.

Note that the KRA archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,

Catatonit is a /sbin/init program for use within containers. It
forwards (almost) all signals to the spawned child, tears down
the container when the spawned child exits, and otherwise
cleans up other exited processes (zombies).

This is a reimplementation of other container init programs (such as
""tini"" or ""dumb-init""), but uses modern Linux facilities (such as
signalfd(2)) and has no additional features.
This plugin sets up the use of dnsmasq on a given CNI network so
that Pods can resolve each other by name.  When configured,
the pod and its IP address are added to a network specific hosts file
that dnsmasq will read in.  Similarly, when a pod
is removed from the network, it will remove the entry from the hosts
file.  Each CNI network will have its own dnsmasq instance.
podman (Pod Manager) is a fully featured container engine that is a simple

Most podman commands can be run as a regular user, without requiring
additional privileges.

python2-debug provides a version of the Python 2 runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users, such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python 2 build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues, and other bugs.

The bytecodes are unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between the two
version of Python 2, but the debugging features mean that C/C++ extension modules
are ABI-incompatible with those built for the standard runtime.

It shares installation directories with the standard Python 2 runtime, so that
.py and .pyc files can be shared.  All compiled extension modules gain a ""_d""
suffix (""foo_d.so"" rather than ""foo.so"") so that each Python 2 implementation can
load its own extensions.
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that documentation for Python 2 is provided in the python2-docs

redis,"Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data

incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

3.0.
Ruby provides built-in support for arbitrary precision integer arithmetic.
For example:

42**13 -> 1265437718438866624512

BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very accurate floating
point numbers. Decimal arithmetic is also useful for general calculation,
because it provides the correct answers people expect–whereas normal binary
floating point arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the
conversion between base 10 and base 2.
IO/Console provides very simple and portable access to console. It doesn't
provide higher layer features, such like curses and readline.
Psych is a YAML parser and emitter. Psych leverages
libyaml[http://pyyaml.org/wiki/LibYAML] for its YAML parsing and emitting

Test::Unit (test-unit) is unit testing framework for Ruby, based on xUnit
principles. These were originally designed by Kent Beck, creator of extreme
programming software development methodology, for Smalltalk's SUnit. It allows
writing tests, checking results and automated testing in Ruby.
This package includes the libruby, necessary to run Ruby.
Rake is a Make-like program implemented in Ruby. Tasks and dependencies are
specified in standard Ruby syntax.
Bundler manages an application's dependencies through its entire life, across

from the terminal.
RDoc produces HTML and command-line documentation for Ruby projects.  RDoc
includes the 'rdoc' and 'ri' tools for generating and displaying online
documentation.
Power Assert shows each value of variables and method calls in the expression.
It is useful for testing, providing which value wasn't correct when the
condition is not satisfied.
Really Simple Syndication (RSS) is a family of formats that describe 'feeds',
specially constructed XML documents that allow an interested person to subscribe
and receive updates from a particular web service. This library provides tooling
to read and create these feeds.
Ruby is the interpreted scripting language for quick and easy
object-oriented programming.  It has many features to process text
files and to do system management tasks (as in Perl).  It is simple,
straight-forward, and extensible.
RubyGems is the Ruby standard for publishing and managing third party
libraries.
REXML was inspired by the Electric XML library for Java, which features an
easy-to-use API, small size, and speed. Hopefully, REXML, designed with the same
philosophy, has these same features. I've tried to keep the API as intuitive as
possible, and have followed the Ruby methodology for method naming and code
flow, rather than mirroring the Java API.

REXML supports both tree and stream document parsing. Stream parsing is faster
(about 1.5 times as fast). However, with stream parsing, you don't get access to
features such as XPath.
This is a implementation of the JSON specification according to RFC 4627.
You can think of it as a low fat alternative to XML, if you want to store
data to disk or transmit it over a network rather than use a verbose
markup language.

velocity,,,"Demonstrations and samples for velocity.
Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the
simple yet powerful template language to reference objects defined in
Java code.
When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can
focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can
focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code
from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long
run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or
PHP.
Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for
example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more
information on XML transformations) from templates. It can be used
either as a standalone utility for generating source code and reports,
or as an integrated component of other systems. Velocity also provides
template services for the Turbine web application framework.
Velocity+Turbine provides a template service that will allow web
applications to be developed according to a true MVC model.

xerces-j2,,,"This package contains the API documentation for xerces-j2.
Demonstrations and samples for xerces-j2.
Welcome to the future! Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance,
fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family. This new version of
Xerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for
building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and
easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other
parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces
Native Interface. For complete design and implementation documents, refer to
the XNI Manual.

Xerces2 is a fully conforming XML Schema processor. For more information,
refer to the XML Schema page.

Xerces2 also provides a complete implementation of the Document Object Model
Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations and provides a complete
implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Recommendation. It also
provides support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1.

Xerces2 is able to parse documents written according to the XML 1.1
Recommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to enable
normalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this specification. It
also handles name spaces according to the XML Namespaces 1.1 Recommendation,
and will correctly serialize XML 1.1 documents if the DOM level 3 load/save
APIs are in use.

xmlstreambuffer,,,"A stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML
info-set in Java. Stream buffers are designed to: provide
very efficient stream-based memory representations of XML
info-sets; and be created and processed using any Java-based
XML API.
Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
 and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like
 SAX or StAX.

jack-audio-connection-kit,,,"Small example clients that use the Jack Audio Connection Kit.
Launcher to start Jack through D-Bus.
JACK is a low-latency audio server, written primarily for the Linux operating
system. It can connect a number of different applications to an audio device, as
well as allowing them to share audio between themselves. Its clients can run in
their own processes (i.e. as a normal application), or can they can run within a
JACK server (i.e. a ""plugin"").

JACK is different from other audio server efforts in that it has been designed
from the ground up to be suitable for professional audio work. This means that
it focuses on two key areas: synchronous execution of all clients, and low
latency operation.

Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write
JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java
class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be
implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.

BSF supports several scripting languages currently:
* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
* Python (using either Jython or JPython)
* Tcl (using Jacl)
* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)

dwarves,"dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

provides a way to represent that document for easy and efficient
reading, manipulation, and writing. It has a straightforward API, is a
lightweight and fast, and is optimized for the Java programmer. It's an
alternative to DOM and SAX, although it integrates well with both DOM

JDOM is a Java-oriented object model which models XML documents.
It provides a Java-centric means of generating and manipulating
XML documents. While JDOM inter-operates well with existing
standards such as the Simple API for XML (SAX) and the Document
Object Model (DOM), it is not an abstraction layer or
enhancement to those APIs. Rather, it seeks to provide a robust,
light-weight means of reading and writing XML data without the
complex and memory-consumptive options that current API
offerings provide.

cmocka,"There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

This is the successor of Google's Cmockery.

This API is concerned with firing a Maven build in a new JVM. It accomplishes
its task by building up a conventional Maven command line from options given in
the current request, along with those global options specified in the invoker
itself. Once it has the command line, the invoker will execute it, and capture
the resulting exit code or any exception thrown to signal a failure to execute.

objenesis,,,"Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.

and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read several dialects of
Markdown and (subsets of) HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, DocBook, JATS,
MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, TikiWiki markup, Creole 1.0, Haddock markup,
OPML, Emacs Org-Mode, Emacs Muse, txt2tags, Vimwiki, Word Docx, ODT, and
Textile, and it can write Markdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML 5, LaTeX,
ConTeXt, DocBook, JATS, OPML, TEI, OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, RTF,
MediaWiki, DokuWiki, ZimWiki, Textile, groff man, groff ms, plain text, Emacs
Org-Mode, AsciiDoc, Haddock markup, EPUB (v2 and v3), FictionBook2, InDesign
ICML, Muse, LaTeX beamer slides, PowerPoint, and several kinds of
HTML/JavaScript slide shows (S5, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js).

In contrast to most existing tools for converting Markdown to HTML, pandoc has
a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which parse text in a given
format and produce a native representation of the document, and a set of
writers, which convert this native representation into a target format.
Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.

speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly).

to learn a new build tool syntax. SCons maintains a global view of
all dependencies in a tree, and can scan source (or other) files for
implicit dependencies, such as files specified on #include lines. SCons
uses MD5 signatures to rebuild only when the contents of a file have
really changed, not just when the timestamp has been touched. SCons
supports side-by-side variant builds, and is easily extended with user-

yasm,"Yasm is a complete rewrite of the NASM assembler under the ""new"" BSD License
(some portions are under other licenses, see COPYING for details). It is
designed from the ground up to allow for multiple assembler syntaxes to be
supported (eg, NASM, TASM, GAS, etc.) in addition to multiple output object
formats and even multiple instruction sets. Another primary module of the
overall design is an optimizer module.
