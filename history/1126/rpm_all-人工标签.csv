Supported FreeIPA Versions

FreeIPA versions 4.6 and up are supported by all roles.

The client role supports versions 4.4 and up, the server role is working with
versions 4.5 and up, the replica role is currently only working with versions
4.6 and up.

Supported Distributions

- RHEL/CentOS 7.4+
- Fedora 26+
- Ubuntu
- Debian 10+ (ipaclient only, no server or replica!)

Requirements

  Controller
  - Ansible version: 2.8+ (ansible-freeipa is an Ansible Collection)
  - /usr/bin/kinit is required on the controller if a one time password (OTP)
    is used

  Node
  - Supported FreeIPA version (see above)
  - Supported distribution (needed for package installation only, see above)

Limitations

External signed CA is now supported. But the currently needed two step process
is an issue for the processing in a simple playbook.
Work is planned to have a new method to handle CSR for external signed CAs in
a separate step before starting the server installation.","Roles and playbooks to deploy FreeIPA servers, replicas and clients",ansible-freeipa-1.6.3-1.an8.src.rpm,应用工具

Ansible roles, including:

redhat.rhel_metrics.pcp
A role for core PCP capabilities, configuring live performance analysis
with a large base set of metrics from the kernel and system services, as
well as data recording and rule inference.

redhat.rhel_metrics.redis
A role for configuring a local Redis server, suitable for use with a
Performance Co-Pilot archive repository (for single or many hosts) and
fast, scalable querying of metrics.

redhat.rhel_metrics.grafana
A role for configuring a local Grafana server, providing web frontend
visuals for Performance Co-Pilot metrics, both live and historically.
Data sources for Vector (live), Redis (historical) and interactive
bpftrace (eBPF) scripts can be configured by this role.  The PCP REST
API service (from the core pcp role) should be configured in order to
use this role.

redhat.rhel_metrics.bpftrace
A role that extends the core PCP role, providing metrics from bpftrace
scripts using Linux eBPF facilities.  Configuring authentication of a
local user capable of running bpftrace scripts via the PCP agent is a
key task of this role.

redhat.rhel_metrics.elasticsearch
A role that extends the core PCP role, providing metrics from a live
ElasticSearch instance for PCP analysis or exporting of PCP metric

of performance data.",Ansible Metric collection for Performance Co-Pilot,ansible-pcp-2.2.2-2.an8.src.rpm,应用工具

embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.

BSF supports several scripting languages currently:
* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
* Python (using either Jython or JPython)
* Tcl (using Jacl)
* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)
* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and

are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

personal mail, system-wide bulletin boards, news-feeds, calendar and contacts
through the IMAP, JMAP, NNTP, CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The Cyrus IMAP
server is a scalable enterprise groupware system designed for use from small to
large enterprise environments using technologies based on well-established Open
Standards.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

environment-modules-4.5.2-1.an8,"The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of
a user's environment via modulefiles.

Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
suite of different applications.

have access to the module alias.",Provides dynamic modification of a user's environment,,,environment-modules-4.5.2-1.an8.src.rpm,系统工具

Cpp is a macro processor which is used automatically
by the C compiler to transform your program before actual

you to define macros, abbreviations for longer

The C preprocessor provides four separate functionalities: the
inclusion of header files (files of declarations that can be
substituted into your program); macro expansion (you can define macros,
and the C preprocessor will replace the macros with their definitions
throughout the program); conditional compilation (using special
preprocessing directives, you can include or exclude parts of the
program according to various conditions); and line control (if you use
a program to combine or rearrange source files into an intermediate
file which is then compiled, you can use line control to inform the
compiler about where each source line originated).

textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on

an existing Windows VM.

Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.

capable tool.

Virt-format is a command line tool to erase and make blank disks.

Virt-get-kernel extracts a kernel/initrd from a disk image.

Virt-inspector examines a virtual machine and tries to determine the
version of the OS, the kernel version, what drivers are installed,
whether the virtual machine is fully virtualized (FV) or
para-virtualized (PV), what applications are installed and more.

People who need to take a look at logs often have a common problem. Logs from
different machines (from different vendors) usually have different formats for
their logs. Even if it is the same type of log (e.g. from firewalls), the log
entries are so different, that it is pretty hard to read these. This is where
liblognorm comes into the game. With this tool you can normalize all your logs.

objenesis-2.6-2.module+el8.2.0+10048+55533a4a,,,"Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.",A library for instantiating Java objects,objenesis-2.6-2.module+el8.2.0+10048+55533a4a.src.rpm,应用库

Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers). A UUID is 128

UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and later in
the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment.
Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity
for various software components. Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and components
across network-connected systems.

The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in the
Internet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).
It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDs
and supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -
and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and very
persistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing

its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so

done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

PMI-1 predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains
challenging.

providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference

university logos, handwritten notes, etc. The resulting image is not ""jaggy""
like a bitmap, but smooth. It can then be rendered at any resolution.

Potrace can currently produce the following output formats: EPS, PostScript,
PDF, SVG (scalable vector graphics), Xfig, Gimppath, and PGM (for easy
antialiasing). Additional backends might be added in the future.

size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as
a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides
the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are
tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics

space and time, with respect to the space of all UUIDs.  A UUID can
be used for multiple purposes, from tagging objects with an extremely
short lifetime, to reliably identifying very persistent objects
across a network.
