Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its

as little as possible."

execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting
extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your

google-guice,库,库, Lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 5 and above," Put simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new
in your Java code. Think of Guice's @Inject as the new new. You will

depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test
and reuse in other contexts.

Guice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to
features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You
might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework."

libxcrypt,库,库,"Extended crypt library for DES, MD5, Blowfish and others ","libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt. "

libffi,库,库,A portable foreign function interface library ,"Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages. "

xmlstreambuffer,库,库, XML Stream Buffer," A stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML
info-set in Java. Stream buffers are designed to: provide
very efficient stream-based memory representations of XML
info-sets; and be created and processed using any Java-based
XML API.
Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
 and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like
 SAX or StAX."

perl-Test-Warnings,库,库, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan."

perl-Dist-CheckConflicts,库,库, Declare version conflicts for your dist," One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module
attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify conflicting
versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done
installing.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing
module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to do
this manually."

driver. Another common use-case is pass-through drivers and driver
stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
virtualization.

driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the
moment of discovery, but can also change already assigned drivers,
assuming they are not in use by the system. The driver overrides
created by driverctl are persistent across system reboots

versions from BSR/Y&Y, or True Type versions from Kinch, PCTeX,
etc.). In fact, since modern distributions will automatically
generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider

fonts. Note that the LaTeX distribution now contains a package
fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing
the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts."

caption package to produce its subcaptions. The major advantage
to the new package is that the user interface is keyword/value
driven and easier to use. To ease the transition from the
subfigure package it includes a configuration file (subfig.cfg)

makes them work as one would expect whether or not there is an
intervening line break. The single most ambitious goal of the
package, however, is to support automatic linebreaking of
displayed equations. Such linebreaking cannot be done without
substantial changes under the hood in the way formulae are
processed; the code must be watched carefully, keeping an eye
on possible glitches. The bundle also contains the flexisym and
mathstyle packages, which are both designated as support for
breqn."

textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.

For Perl bindings, see 'perl-hivex'.

For Python 3 bindings, see 'python3-hivex'.

For Ruby bindings, see 'ruby-hivex'."
