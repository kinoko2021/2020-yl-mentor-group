use constant PI => 4 * atan2(1, 1);

When you declare a constant such as ""PI"" using the method shown above,
each machine your script runs upon can have as many digits of accuracy
as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely
to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to
send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its
value at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.
In particular, any code in an ""if (CONSTANT)"" block will be optimized
away if the constant is false. "

the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
ETSI standard test patterns."

reproduce the outlines of the original Adobe fonts. The SC and
OsF in the FPL Fonts were designed with the glyphs from URW
Palladio L as starting point. For some glyphs (e.g. 'o') I got
the best result by scaling and boldening. For others (e.g. 'h')
shifting selected portions of the character gave more
satisfying results. All this was done using the free font
editor FontForge. The kerning data in these fonts comes from
Walter Schmidt's improved Palatino metrics. LaTeX use is
enabled by the mathpazo package, which is part of the psnfss
distribution."

* PLY provides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support
  for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support
  for ambiguous grammars.
* PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.
* PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less than provide the basic lex/yacc
  functionality. In other words, it's not a large parsing framework or a
  component of some larger system.

perl-Eval-Closure,库, Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval," String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which

its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly)."

libcmocka,库, Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C," There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

This is the successor of Google's Cmockery."

objenesis,库, A library for instantiating Java objects," Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways."

UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and later in

Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity
for various software components. Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and components
across network-connected systems.

The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in the
Internet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).
It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDs
and supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -
and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and very
persistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.

This module provides several methods to create a UUID. In all methods,
<namespace> is a UUID and <name> is a free form string."

Werkzeug started as simple collection of various utilities for WSGI
applications and has become one of the most advanced WSGI utility
modules.  It includes a powerful debugger, full featured request and
response objects, HTTP utilities to handle entity tags, cache control
headers, HTTP dates, cookie handling, file uploads, a powerful URL
routing system and a bunch of community contributed addon modules.

engine, database adapter or anything else.  It doesn't even enforce
a specific way of handling requests and leaves all that up to the
developer. It's most useful for end user applications which should work
on as many server environments as possible (such as blogs, wikis,

able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility

implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.

BSF supports several scripting languages currently:
* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
* Python (using either Jython or JPython)
* Tcl (using Jacl)
* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)
* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and
Xerces)

In addition, the following languages are supported with their own BSF
engines:
* Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)
* JRuby
* JudoScript"

lato-fonts,其它, A sanserif typeface family," Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer _ukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics."

Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
pslatex is widely considered obsolete."

GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results."
