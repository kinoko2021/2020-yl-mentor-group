driverctl,工具,库, Device driver control utility," driverctl is a tool for manipulating and inspecting the system

work around a regression in a driver or to try an experimental alternative
driver. Another common use-case is pass-through drivers and driver
stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
virtualization.

driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the
moment of discovery, but can also change already assigned drivers,
assuming they are not in use by the system. The driver overrides
created by driverctl are persistent across system reboots
by default."

hivex,工具,库, Read and write Windows Registry binary hive files," Hive files are the undocumented binary files that Windows uses to

binary file.

'hivexregedit' (in perl-hivex) lets you export and merge to the
textual regedit format.

'hivexml' can be used to convert a hive file to a more useful XML
format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.
