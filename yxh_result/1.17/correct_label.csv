Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
suite of different applications.

NOTE: You will need to get a new shell after installing this package to
have access to the module alias. ",工具

ypserv,服务,工具, The NIS (Network Information Service) server," The Network Information Service (NIS) is a system that provides
network information (login names, passwords, home directories, group
information) to all of the machines on a network. NIS can allow users
to log in on any machine on the network, as long as the machine has
the NIS client programs running and the user's password is recorded in
the NIS passwd database. NIS was formerly known as Sun Yellow Pages
(YP).

This package provides the NIS server, which will need to be running on
your network. NIS clients do not need to be running the server.

Install ypserv if you need an NIS server for your network. You also
need to install the yp-tools and ypbind packages on any NIS client
machines.",服务

ctags,工具,库, A C programming language indexing and/or cross-reference tool," Ctags generates an index (or tag) file of C language objects found in
C source and header files.  The index makes it easy for text editors or
other utilities to locate the indexed items.  Ctags can also generate a
cross reference file which lists information about the various objects
found in a set of C language files in human readable form.  Exuberant
Ctags improves on ctags because it can find all types of C language tags,
including macro definitions, enumerated values (values inside enum{...}),
function and method definitions, enum/struct/union tags, external
function prototypes, typedef names and variable declarations.  Exuberant
Ctags is far less likely to be fooled by code containing #if preprocessor
conditional constructs than ctags.  Exuberant ctags supports output of
Emacs style TAGS files and can be used to print out a list of selected
objects found in source files.

Install ctags if you are going to use your system for C programming.",工具
