He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats whenused in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in theuppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the sametime, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Latowas designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while thestrong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, seriousbut friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including abeautiful hairline style.

Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDsvery extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and componentsacross network-connected systems.The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in theInternet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDsand supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and verypersistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.This module provides several methods to create a UUID.
