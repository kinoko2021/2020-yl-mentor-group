The package issupplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command thatallows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, withoutneeding to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses adifferent technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courieras a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width availablenow, than there were when pslatex was designed).

String eval is not withoutits issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (whichdetermines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quiteslow, especially if doing a large number of evals.This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides aneval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other thana fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, sothat doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a differentenvironment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of thestring to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if cachingis to work properly).Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval",1,1

IfFoo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would causeBar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend onthe fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intentproperly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be forthere to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that wouldlet CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existingmodule is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to dothis manually.Declare version conflicts for your dist",1,1

Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDsvery extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and componentsacross network-connected systems.The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in theInternet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDsand supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and verypersistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.This module provides several methods to create a UUID.

Itsupports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based passwordhashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered byOpenwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt','crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and othersimilar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords duringan interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is notsuitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in anyother situation where speed is more important than careful handling ofsensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweightenough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attemptsper minute.On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backwardcompatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc'slibcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  Wehave taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as wereused by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for thevariety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched intoglibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcryptwill not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certainlegacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r','setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt.",0,0

Using theCertificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request format, a request isgenerated for the user's private encryption key.  This key is then stored inthe KRA which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can onlybe decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing forprotection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.Note that the KRA archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,since such archival would undermine non-repudiation properties of signing keys.PKI KRA Package",2,1
