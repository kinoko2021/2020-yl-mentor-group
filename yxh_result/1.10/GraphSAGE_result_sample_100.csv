google-guice,库,工具, Lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 5 and above," Put simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new

depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test
and reuse in other contexts.

Guice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to
features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You
might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework."

intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like

libraries. However, SIP can be used to generate Python bindings for any C++
class library."
