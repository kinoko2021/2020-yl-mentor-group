format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.

the Adobe fonts by scaling Helvetica by 90%, and 'condensing'
Courier (i.e. scaling horizontally) by 85%. The package is
supplied with a (unix) shell file for a 'pslatex' command that
allows standard LaTeX documents to be processed, without
needing to edit the file. Note that current psnfss uses a
different technique for scaling Helvetica, and treats Courier
as a lost cause (there are better free fixed-width available
now, than there were when pslatex was designed). As a result,
pslatex is widely considered obsolete."

perl-Dist-CheckConflicts,库,服务, Declare version conflicts for your dist," One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module
attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify conflicting
versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done
installing.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing
module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to do
this manually."

Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity
for various software components. Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and components
across network-connected systems.

The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in the
Internet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).
It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDs
and supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -
and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and very
persistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.

This module provides several methods to create a UUID. In all methods,

Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible."

might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework."

xmlstreambuffer,库,工具, XML Stream Buffer," A stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML
info-set in Java. Stream buffers are designed to: provide
very efficient stream-based memory representations of XML
info-sets; and be created and processed using any Java-based
XML API.
Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
 and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like
 SAX or StAX."

as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely
to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to
send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its
value at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.
In particular, any code in an ""if (CONSTANT)"" block will be optimized
away if the constant is false. "

perl-Data-OptList,库,服务, Parse and validate simple name/value option pairs," Hashes are great for storing named data, but if you want more than one entry

to write:

$values = [
    foo => undef,
    bar => undef,
    baz => undef,
    xyz => { ... },
];

With Data::OptList, you can do this instead:

$values = Data::OptList::mkopt([
    qw(foo bar baz),
    xyz => { ... },
]);

This works by assuming that any defined scalar is a name and any reference
following a name is its value."

perl-Test-Warnings,库,服务, Test for warnings and the lack of them," If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan."

from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long
run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or
PHP.
Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for
example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more
information on XML transformations) from templates. It can be used
either as a standalone utility for generating source code and reports,
or as an integrated component of other systems. Velocity also provides
template services for the Turbine web application framework.

applications to be developed according to a true MVC model."

libecap,库,服务, Squid interface for embedded adaptation modules," eCAP is a software interface that allows a network application, such as an
HTTP proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and adaptation to
a loadable module. For each applicable protocol message being processed, an
eCAP-enabled host application supplies the message details to the adaptation
module and gets back an adapted message, a ""not interested"" response, or a
""block this message now!"" instruction. These exchanges often include message
bodies.

The adaptation module can also exchange meta-information with the host
application to supply additional details such as configuration options, a
reason behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus name.

perl-Eval-Closure,库,服务, Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval," String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which
speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly)."
