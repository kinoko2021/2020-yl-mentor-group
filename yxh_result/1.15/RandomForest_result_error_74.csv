difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:

* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required

perl-Dist-CheckConflicts,库,工具, Declare version conflicts for your dist," One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module
attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify conflicting
versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done
installing.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing

this manually.",库
