munge-maven-plugin,库,工具, Munge Maven Plugin," Munge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports
conditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the
form ""if[tag]"", ""if_not[tag]"", ""else[tag]"", and ""end[tag]"".
Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible."

bsf,库,工具, Bean Scripting Framework," Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write
JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java
class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be
implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.

BSF supports several scripting languages currently:
* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
* Python (using either Jython or JPython)
* Tcl (using Jacl)
* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)
* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and
Xerces)

In addition, the following languages are supported with their own BSF
engines:
* Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)
* JRuby
* JudoScript"

many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is
embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to
execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting
extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your
Java applications and objects from BeanShell; working with Java
objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and
runs in the same space as your application, you can freely pass
references to ""real live"" objects into scripts and return them as
results."

to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to
send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its
value at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.
In particular, any code in an ""if (CONSTANT)"" block will be optimized
away if the constant is false. "

XML API.
Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
 and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like
 SAX or StAX."

reason behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus name.

redis,服务,工具, A persistent key-value database," Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

You can use Redis from most programming languages also."

binary file.

format.

In order to get access to the hive files themselves, you can copy them
from a Windows machine.  They are usually found in
%systemroot%\system32\config.  For virtual machines we recommend
using libguestfs or guestfish to copy out these files.  libguestfs
also provides a useful high-level tool called 'virt-win-reg' (based on
hivex technology) which can be used to query specific registry keys in
an existing Windows VM.

using scalable versions of the cm fonts (Bakoma, or the
versions from BSR/Y&Y, or True Type versions from Kinch, PCTeX,
etc.). In fact, since modern distributions will automatically
generate any bitmap font you might need, type1cm has wider

fix-cm, which performs the task of type1cm, as well as doing
the same job for T1- and TS1-encoded ec fonts."
