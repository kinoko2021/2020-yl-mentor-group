ability to reboot will depend on the state of the machine and interrupts.

reset (or whatever action was configured to be taken upon watchdog timer
expiration) initiated by the BMC. "

each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very

designer _ukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, _ukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says _ukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics."

stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
virtualization.

driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the

available Adobe Type 1 fonts. The font set consists of the
'LaserWriter 35' set (originally 'freely available' because
embedded in PostScript printers), and a variety of other free
fonts, together with some additions. Note that while many of
the fonts are available in PostScript (and other) printers,
most publishers require fonts embedded in documents, which
requires that you have the fonts in your TeX system.
Fortunately, there are free versions of the fonts from URW
(available in the URW base5 bundle). The base set of text fonts
covered by PSNFSS are: AvantGarde, Bookman, Courier, Helvetica,
New Century Schoolbook, Palatino, Symbol, Times Roman and Zapf
Dingbats. In addition, the fonts Bitstream Charter and Adobe
Utopia are covered (those fonts were contributed to the Public
Domain by their commercial foundries). Separate packages are
provided to load each font for use as main text font. The
packages helvet (which allows Helvetica to be loaded with its
size scaled to something more nearly appropriate for its use as
a Sans-Serif font to match Times) and pifont (which provides
the means to select single glyphs from symbol fonts) are
tailored to special requirements of their fonts. Mathematics
are covered by the mathptmx package, which constructs passable
mathematics from a combination of Times Roman, Symbol and some
glyphs from Computer Modern, and by Pazo Math (optionally
extended with the fpl small-caps and old-style figures fonts)
which uses Palatino as base font, with the mathpazo fonts. The
bundle as a whole is part of the LaTeX 'required' set of
packages."

munge-maven-plugin,库,工具, Munge Maven Plugin," Munge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports
conditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the
form ""if[tag]"", ""if_not[tag]"", ""else[tag]"", and ""end[tag]"".
Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible."

as it can use. Also, your program will be easier to read, more likely
to be maintained (and maintained correctly), and far less likely to
send a space probe to the wrong planet because nobody noticed the one
equation in which you wrote 3.14195.

When a constant is used in an expression, Perl replaces it with its
value at compile time, and may then optimize the expression further.
In particular, any code in an ""if (CONSTANT)"" block will be optimized
away if the constant is false. "

PMI-1 predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains
challenging.

PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by
providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference
implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of
scalability."

in the world to play with, and even if you _do_ check it, producing a

takes the hard work out of calling external commands. In fact, if you
want to be really lazy, you can just write:

    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);

and all of your ""system"" commands will either succeed (run to completion and
return a zero exit value), or die with rich diagnostic messages."

minimize common mistakes with eval blocks, and NOTHING else.

This is unlike TryCatch, which provides a nice syntax and avoids adding
another call stack layer, and supports calling return from the try block to

perl-Data-UUID,库,工具, Globally/Universally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs/UUIDs)," This module provides a framework for generating v3 UUIDs (Universally Unique
Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers). A UUID is 128
bits long, and is guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs
generated until 3400 CE.

UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and later in
the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment.
Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity
for various software components. Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and components
across network-connected systems.

The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in the
Internet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).
It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDs
and supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -
and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and very
persistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.

This module provides several methods to create a UUID. In all methods,
<namespace> is a UUID and <name> is a free form string."
