IfFoo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would causeBar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend onthe fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intentproperly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be forthere to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that wouldlet CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existingmodule is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to dothis manually.",0,4470.0,perl-Dist-CheckConflicts,0

For instance, Moose usesit heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, whichspeeds code up at runtime by a significant amount.

It provides aneval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other thana fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, sothat doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a differentenvironment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of thestring to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if cachingis to work properly).",0,4478.0,perl-Eval-Closure,0

3970,,库,"  A library for instantiating Java objects Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiatea new object of a particular class.Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. Thereare many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as whenthe class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictionsin libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructoron object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without callingthe constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain caseswhen this is useful:* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without  needing to worry about the super() constructor.* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in  non-standard ways.",0,3970.0,objenesis,0

Because of this assumption manyframeworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the codemodule being tested which may collide with the custom or incompleteimplementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C librarywhich minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka triesto avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used totest a variety of exotic code.
