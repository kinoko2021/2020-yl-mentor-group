The PT Sans family was developed as part of the __ublic Types of Russian

read and write their native languages, using free/libre fonts. It is
dedicated to the 300-year anniversary of the Russian civil type invented by
Peter the Great from 1708 to 1710, and was realized with financial support
from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.

The fonts include support for all 54 title鹿 languages of the Russian
Federation as well as more common Western, Central European and Cyrillic
blocks making them unique and a very important tool for modern digital
communications.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible.",0
