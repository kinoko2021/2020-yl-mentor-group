libcmocka,应用库,核心,库,Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C,"There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

This is the successor of Google's Cmockery."

work around a regression in a driver or to try an experimental alternative
driver. Another common use-case is pass-through drivers and driver
stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
virtualization.

driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the
moment of discovery, but can also change already assigned drivers,
assuming they are not in use by the system. The driver overrides

dwarves,应用工具,系统,工具,Debugging Information Manipulation Tools (pahole & friends),"dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results."

environment-modules,系统工具,核心,工具,Provides dynamic modification of a user's environment,"The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of
a user's environment via modulefiles.

Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
suite of different applications.

NOTE: You will need to get a new shell after installing this package to
have access to the module alias."

in your Java code. Think of Guice's @Inject as the new new. You will
still need to write factories in some cases, but your code will not
depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test
and reuse in other contexts.

Guice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to
features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You
might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework."

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime

resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility or
functionality needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons HTTP
Client component seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient,
up-to-date, and feature-rich package implementing the client side of the
most recent HTTP standards and recommendations.
Designed for extension while providing robust support for the base HTTP
protocol, the HTTP Client component may be of interest to anyone

service clients, or systems that leverage or extend the HTTP protocol

rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference

each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very

teTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system
TeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be
using teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the ""schemes""

configurable (La)TeX-based authoring system for hypertext.
Tex4ht does not parse (La)TeX source (so that it avoids the
difficulties encountered by many other converters, arising from
the irregularity of (La)TeX syntax). Instead, Tex4ht uses
(La)TeX itself (with an extra macro package) to produce a non-
standard DVI file that it can then process. This technique
allows TeX4ht to approach the robustness characteristic of
restricted-syntax systems such as hyperlatex and gellmu. Note
