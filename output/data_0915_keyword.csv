to an API specification like OpenGL has a few advantages too; like being
able to paper over the inconsistencies/bugs of different OpenGL
implementations in a centralized place, not to mention the myriad of OpenGL
extensions. It also means we are in a better position to provide utility
APIs that help software developers since they only need to be implemented
once and there is no risk of inconsistency between implementations.

gsm,"
Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor.","
Contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an implementation of
the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for full-rate speech
transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP (residual pulse
excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.

GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 162 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
with typical UNIX applications, our implementation turns frames of 160
16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).

The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
ETSI standard test patterns.",libraries gsm compressor ,compression gsm libgsm speaker libraries ,shared library speech ,implementation transcoding standard library frame ,0,应用库

retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming enabled should
be able to find a document containing ""cycling"" given the query
""cycles"".

Byte Code Engineering Library.","
This package provides API documentation for bcel.
The Byte Code Engineering Library (formerly known as JavaClass) is
intended to give users a convenient possibility to analyze, create, and
manipulate (binary) Java class files (those ending with .class). Classes
are represented by objects which contain all the symbolic information of
the given class: methods, fields and byte code instructions, in
particular.  Such objects can be read from an existing file, be
transformed by a program (e.g. a class loader at run-time) and dumped to
a file again. An even more interesting application is the creation of
classes from scratch at run-time. The Byte Code Engineering Library
(BCEL) may be also useful if you want to learn about the Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) and the format of Java .class files.  BCEL is already
being used successfully in several projects such as compilers,
optimizers, obsfuscators and analysis tools, the most popular probably
being the Xalan XSLT processor at Apache.",bcel documentation byte ,javaclass bcel compilers documentation byte ,byte code engineering ,class bcel file give java ,1,none

Debugging information  processing library.","
dwarves is a set of tools that use the debugging information inserted in
ELF binaries by compilers such as GCC, used by well known debuggers such as
GDB, and more recent ones such as systemtap.

Utilities in the dwarves suite include pahole, that can be used to find
alignment holes in structs and classes in languages such as C, C++, but not
limited to these.

It also extracts other information such as CPU cacheline alignment, helping
pack those structures to achieve more cache hits.

These tools can also be used to encode and read the BTF type information format
used with the Linux kernel bpf syscall, using 'pahole -J' and 'pahole -F btf'.

A diff like tool, codiff can be used to compare the effects changes in source
code generate on the resulting binaries.

Another tool is pfunct, that can be used to find all sorts of information about
functions, inlines, decisions made by the compiler about inlining, etc.

One example of pfunct usage is in the fullcircle tool, a shell that drivers
pfunct to generate compileable code out of a .o file and then build it using
gcc, with the same compiler flags, and then use codiff to make sure the
original .o file and the new one generated from debug info produces the same
debug info.

Pahole also can be used to use all this type information to pretty print raw data
according to command line directions.

Headers can have its data format described from debugging info and offsets from
it can be used to further format a number of records.

The btfdiff utility compares the output of pahole from BTF and DWARF to make
sure they produce the same results.

Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source libraries.  The
emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++ Standard
Library, in the hopes of establishing ""existing practice"" for
extensions and providing reference implementations so that the Boost
libraries are suitable for eventual standardization. (Some of the
libraries have already been included in the C++ 2011 standard and
others have been proposed to the C++ Standards Committee for inclusion
in future standards.)

Run-time support for Boost.Atomic, a library that provides atomic data
types and operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
variables.

Run-time support for Boost.Chrono, a set of useful time utilities.

Boost.Container library implements several well-known containers,
including STL containers. The aim of the library is to offer advanced
features not present in standard containers or to offer the latest
standard draft features for compilers that comply with C++03.

Run-time support for Boost.Context, a foundational library that
provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread.
Run-time support for Boost.Coroutine, a library that provides
generalized subroutines which allow multiple entry points for
suspending and resuming execution.

Run-time support for Boost Date Time, a set of date-time libraries based
on generic programming concepts.

Run-time support for the Boost Fiber library, a framework for
micro-/userland-threads (fibers) scheduled cooperatively.

Run-time support for the Boost Filesystem Library, which provides
portable facilities to query and manipulate paths, files, and
directories.

Run-time support for the BGL graph library.  BGL interface and graph
components are generic, in the same sense as the Standard Template
Library (STL).

Run-time support for Boost.Iostreams, a framework for defining streams,
stream buffers and i/o filters.

Run-time support for Boost.Locale, a set of localization and Unicode
handling tools.

Boost.Log library aims to make logging significantly easier for the
application developer.  It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
tools along with public interfaces for extending the library.

Run-time support for C99 and C++ TR1 C-style Functions from the math
portion of Boost.TR1.

Run-time support of boost program options library, which allows program
developers to obtain (name, value) pairs from the user, via
conventional methods such as command-line and configuration file.

Run-time support for boost random library.

Run-time support for boost regular expression library.

Run-time support for serialization for persistence and marshaling.

Run-time support for managed signals & slots callback implementation.

Run-time component of the Boost stacktrace library.

Run-time component of Boost operating system support library, including
the diagnostics support that is part of the C++11 standard library.

Run-time component Boost.Thread library, which provides classes and
functions for managing multiple threads of execution, and for
synchronizing data between the threads or providing separate copies of
data specific to individual threads.

""How long does my C++ code take to run?""
The Boost Timer library answers that question and does so portably,
with as little as one #include and one additional line of code.

The Boost.TypeErasure library provides runtime polymorphism in C++
that is more flexible than that provided by the core language.

preprocessor functionality.",boost libraries logging ,boost compilers implementations runtime libraries ,library boost run-time ,library support provide run-time standard ,1,应用库
cmocka,"
Lightweight library to simplify and generalize unit tests for C.","
There are a variety of C unit testing frameworks available however many of them
are fairly complex and require the latest compiler technology. Some development
requires the use of old compilers which makes it difficult to use some unit
testing frameworks. In addition many unit testing frameworks assume the code
being tested is an application or module that is targeted to the same platform
that will ultimately execute the test. Because of this assumption many
frameworks require the inclusion of standard C library headers in the code
module being tested which may collide with the custom or incomplete
implementation of the C library utilized by the code under test.

CMocka only requires a test application is linked with the standard C library
which minimizes conflicts with standard C library headers. Also, CMocka tries
to avoid the use of some of the newer features of C compilers.

This results in CMocka being a relatively small library that can be used to
test a variety of exotic code. If a developer wishes to simply test an
application with the latest compiler then other unit testing frameworks may be
preferable.

Provides dynamic modification of a user's environment.","
The Environment Modules package provides for the dynamic modification of
a user's environment via modulefiles.

Each modulefile contains the information needed to configure the shell
for an application. Once the Modules package is initialized, the
environment can be modified on a per-module basis using the module
command which interprets modulefiles. Typically modulefiles instruct
the module command to alter or set shell environment variables such as
PATH, MANPATH, etc. modulefiles may be shared by many users on a system
and users may have their own collection to supplement or replace the
shared modulefiles.

Modules can be loaded and unloaded dynamically and atomically, in an
clean fashion. All popular shells are supported, including bash, ksh,
zsh, sh, csh, tcsh, as well as some scripting languages such as perl.

Modules are useful in managing different versions of applications.
Modules can also be bundled into metamodules that will load an entire
suite of different applications.

The memkind library is an user extensible heap manager built on top of

are defined by operating system memory policies that have been applied
to virtual address ranges. Memory characteristics supported by
memkind without user extension include control of NUMA and page size
features. The jemalloc non-standard interface has been extended to
enable specialized arenas to make requests for virtual memory from the
operating system through the memkind partition interface. Through the
other memkind interfaces the user can control and extend memory
partition features and allocate memory while selecting enabled
features. This software is being made available for early evaluation.

bad!

and 'after'. 'before' and 'after' are run just before and after the method
they modify, but can not really affect that original method. 'around' is
run in place of the original method, with a hook to easily call that
original method. See the 'MODIFIERS' section for more details on how the

Declare version conflicts for your dist.","
One shortcoming of the CPAN clients that currently exist is that they have no
way of specifying conflicting downstream dependencies of modules. This module
attempts to work around this issue by allowing you to specify conflicting
versions of modules separately, and deal with them after the module is done
installing.

For instance, say you have a module Foo, and some other module Bar uses Foo. If
Foo were to change its API in a non-backwards-compatible way, this would cause
Bar to break until it is updated to use the new API. Foo can't just depend on
the fixed version of Bar, because this will cause a circular dependency
(because Bar is already depending on Foo), and this doesn't express intent
properly anyway - Foo doesn't use Bar at all. The ideal solution would be for
there to be a way to specify conflicting versions of modules in a way that would
let CPAN clients update conflicting modules automatically after an existing
module is upgraded, but until that happens, this module will allow users to do
this manually.",dist conflicts declare ,cpan dependency modules conflicting downstream ,declare version conflict ,module version conflict specify would ,1,应用库

perl-Eval-Closure,"
Safely and cleanly create closures via string eval.","
String eval is often used for dynamic code generation. For instance, Moose uses
it heavily, to generate inlined versions of accessors and constructors, which
speeds code up at runtime by a significant amount. String eval is not without
its issues however - it's difficult to control the scope it's used in (which
determines which variables are in scope inside the eval), and it can be quite
slow, especially if doing a large number of evals.

This module attempts to solve both of those problems. It provides an
eval_closure function, which evals a string in a clean environment, other than
a fixed list of specified variables. It also caches the result of the eval, so
that doing repeated evals of the same source, even with a different
environment, will be much faster (but note that the description is part of the
string to be evaled, so it must also be the same (or non-existent) if caching
is to work properly).",closures eval string ,eval_closure evals eval string runtime ,cleanly create closure ,eval string evals environment code ,1,应用库

perl-Test-Warnings,"
Test for warnings and the lack of them.","
If you've ever tried to use Test::NoWarnings to confirm there are no warnings
generated by your tests, combined with the convenience of done_testing to not
have to declare a test count, you'll have discovered that these two features do
not play well together, as the test count will be calculated before the
warnings test is run, resulting in a TAP error (see examples/test_nowarnings.pl
in this distribution for a demonstration).

This module is intended to be used as a drop-in replacement for
Test::NoWarnings: it also adds an extra test, but runs this test before
done_testing calculates the test count, rather than after. It does this by
hooking into done_testing as well as via an END block. You can declare a plan,
or not, and things will still Just Work.

It is actually equivalent to:

    use Test::NoWarnings 1.04 ':early';

as warnings are still printed normally as they occur. You are safe, and
enthusiastically encouraged, to perform a global search-replace of the above
with use Test::Warnings; whether or not your tests have a plan.",warnings test lack ,test_nowarnings done_testing tests warnings tap ,test warning lack ,test warning done_testing count still ,1,应用库

pmix,"
Process Management Interface Exascale (PMIx).","
The Process Management Interface (PMI) has been used for quite some time as
a means of exchanging wireup information needed for interprocess
communication. Two versions (PMI-1 and PMI-2) have been released as part of
the MPICH effort. While PMI-2 demonstrates better scaling properties than its
PMI-1 predecessor, attaining rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M
processes executing across 100k nodes expected for exascale operations remains
challenging.

PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by
providing an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to
support clusters up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of
the project is not to branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in
fact, PMIx fully supports both of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but
rather to (a) augment and extend those APIs to eliminate some current
restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide a reference
implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of
scalability.",pmix exascale process ,interprocess clusters pmix exascale standard ,process management interface ,pmi-1 wireup pmi-2 exascale support ,1,应用库

libffi,"
A portable foreign function interface library.","
Compilers for high level languages generate code that follow certain
conventions.  These conventions are necessary, in part, for separate
compilation to work.  One such convention is the ""calling convention"".
The calling convention is a set of assumptions made by the compiler
about where function arguments will be found on entry to a function.  A
calling convention also specifies where the return value for a function
is found.

Some programs may not know at the time of compilation what arguments
are to be passed to a function.  For instance, an interpreter may be
told at run-time about the number and types of arguments used to call a
given function.  `Libffi' can be used in such programs to provide a
bridge from the interpreter program to compiled code.

The `libffi' library provides a portable, high level programming
interface to various calling conventions.  This allows a programmer to
call any function specified by a call interface description at run time.

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface.  A foreign function
interface is the popular name for the interface that allows code
written in one language to call code written in another language.  The
`libffi' library really only provides the lowest, machine dependent
layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.  A layer must
exist above `libffi' that handles type conversions for values passed
between the two languages.",interface foreign library ,compilers ffi libffi interface function ,portable foreign function ,function call convention interface code ,1,系统库

Redis is an advanced key-value store. It is often referred to as a data
structure server since keys can contain strings, hashes, lists, sets and
sorted sets.

You can run atomic operations on these types, like appending to a string;
incrementing the value in a hash; pushing to a list; computing set
intersection, union and difference; or getting the member with highest
ranking in a sorted set.

In order to achieve its outstanding performance, Redis works with an
in-memory dataset. Depending on your use case, you can persist it either
by dumping the dataset to disk every once in a while, or by appending
each command to a log.

Redis also supports trivial-to-setup master-slave replication, with very
fast non-blocking first synchronization, auto-reconnection on net split
and so forth.

Other features include Transactions, Pub/Sub, Lua scripting, Keys with a
limited time-to-live, and configuration settings to make Redis behave like
a cache.

disk images.  http://libguestfs.org

It can be used to make batch configuration changes to guests, get
disk used/free statistics (virt-df), migrate between hypervisors
(virt-p2v, virt-v2v), perform backups and guest clones, change
registry/UUID/hostname info, build guests from scratch (virt-builder)
and much more.

Libguestfs uses Linux kernel and qemu code, and can access any type of
guest filesystem that Linux and qemu can, including but not limited
to: ext2/3/4, FAT and NTFS, LVM, many different disk partition
schemes, qcow, qcow2, vmdk.

Libguestfs for Red Hat Enterprise Linux is split into several subpackages.
The basic subpackages are:

               libguestfs  C library
         libguestfs-tools  virt-* tools, guestfish and guestmount (FUSE)
       libguestfs-tools-c  only the subset of virt tools written in C

libecap,"
Squid interface for embedded adaptation modules.","
eCAP is a software interface that allows a network application, such as an
HTTP proxy or an ICAP server, to outsource content analysis and adaptation to
a loadable module. For each applicable protocol message being processed, an
eCAP-enabled host application supplies the message details to the adaptation
module and gets back an adapted message, a ""not interested"" response, or a
""block this message now!"" instruction. These exchanges often include message
bodies.

The adaptation module can also exchange meta-information with the host
application to supply additional details such as configuration options, a
reason behind the decision to ignore a message, or a detected virus name.

If you are familiar with the ICAP protocol (RFC 3507), then you may think of
eCAP as an ""embedded ICAP"", where network interactions with an ICAP server are
replaced with function calls to an adaptation module.",squid adaptation modules ,ecap icap protocol rfc virus ,squid interface embedded ,message application adaptation icap module ,2,none

protocol, as defined in RFC 2865 (and others). It allows Network Access
Servers (NAS boxes) to perform authentication for dial-up users. There are
also RADIUS clients available for Web servers, firewalls, Unix logins, and
more.  Using RADIUS allows authentication and authorization for a network to

driverctl is a tool for manipulating and inspecting the system
device driver choices.

Devices are normally assigned to their sole designated kernel driver
by default. However in some situations it may be desireable to
override that default, for example to try an older driver to
work around a regression in a driver or to try an experimental alternative
driver. Another common use-case is pass-through drivers and driver
stubs to allow userspace to drive the device, such as in case of
virtualization.

driverctl integrates with udev to support overriding
driver selection for both cold- and hotplugged devices from the
moment of discovery, but can also change already assigned drivers,
assuming they are not in use by the system. The driver overrides
created by driverctl are persistent across system reboots

Identifiers, also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers). A UUID is 128
bits long, and is guaranteed to be different from all other UUIDs/GUIDs

UUIDs were originally used in the Network Computing System (NCS) and later in
the Open Software Foundation's (OSF) Distributed Computing Environment.
Currently many different technologies rely on UUIDs to provide unique identity
for various software components. Microsoft COM/DCOM for instance, uses GUIDs
very extensively to uniquely identify classes, applications and components
across network-connected systems.

The algorithm for UUID generation, used by this extension, is described in the
Internet Draft ""UUIDs and GUIDs"" by Paul J. Leach and Rich Salz (see RFC 4122).
It provides a reasonably efficient and reliable framework for generating UUIDs
and supports fairly high allocation rates - 10 million per second per machine -
and therefore is suitable for identifying both extremely short-lived and very
persistent objects on a given system as well as across the network.

libxcrypt,"
Extended crypt library for DES, MD5, Blowfish and others.","
libxcrypt is a modern library for one-way hashing of passwords.  It
supports DES, MD5, SHA-2-256, SHA-2-512, and bcrypt-based password
hashes, and provides the traditional Unix 'crypt' and 'crypt_r'
interfaces, as well as a set of extended interfaces pioneered by
Openwall Linux, 'crypt_rn', 'crypt_ra', 'crypt_gensalt',
'crypt_gensalt_rn', and 'crypt_gensalt_ra'.

libxcrypt is intended to be used by login(1), passwd(1), and other
similar programs; that is, to hash a small number of passwords during
an interactive authentication dialogue with a human.  It is not
suitable for use in bulk password-cracking applications, or in any
other situation where speed is more important than careful handling of
sensitive data.  However, it *is* intended to be fast and lightweight
enough for use in servers that must field thousands of login attempts
per minute.

On Linux-based systems, by default libxcrypt will be binary backward
compatible with the libcrypt.so.1 shipped as part of the GNU C Library.
This means that all existing binary executables linked against glibc's
libcrypt should work unmodified with this library's libcrypt.so.1.  We
have taken pains to provide exactly the same ""symbol versions"" as were
used by glibc on various CPU architectures, and to account for the
variety of ways in which the Openwall extensions were patched into
glibc's libcrypt by some Linux distributions.  (For instance,
compatibility symlinks for SuSE's ""libowcrypt"" are provided.)

However, the converse is not true: programs linked against libxcrypt
will not work with glibc's libcrypt.  Also, programs that use certain
legacy APIs supplied by glibc's libcrypt ('encrypt', 'encrypt_r',
'setkey', 'setkey_r', and 'fcrypt') cannot be compiled against libxcrypt.",crypt md5 blowfish ,libxcrypt libcrypt libowcrypt passwords crypt_gensalt ,extended crypt library ,libxcrypt glibc libcrypt password provide ,2,核心库

      comparison, data extraction)
   -- acpidump: write out the current contents of ACPI tables
   -- acpiexec: simulate AML execution in order to debug method definitions
   -- acpihelp: display help messages describing ASL keywords and op-codes
   -- acpinames: display complete ACPI name space from input AML

Put HID proxying bluetooth HCI's into HCI mode.
Libraries for use in Bluetooth applications.
Object Exchange daemon for sharing content.
Bluetooth utilities.","
Most allinone PC's and bluetooth keyboard / mouse sets which include a
bluetooth dongle, ship with a so called HID proxying bluetooth HCI.
The HID proxying makes the keyboard / mouse show up as regular USB HID
devices (after connecting using the connect button on the device + keyboard),
which makes them work without requiring any manual configuration.

The bluez-hid2hci package contains the hid2hci utility and udev rules to
automatically switch supported Bluetooth devices into regular HCI mode.

Install this package if you want to use the bluetooth function of the HCI
with other bluetooth devices like for example a mobile phone.

Note that after installing this package you will first need to pair your
bluetooth keyboard and mouse with the bluetooth adapter before you can use
them again. Since you cannot use your bluetooth keyboard and mouse until
they are paired, this will require the use of a regular (wired) USB keyboard
and mouse.

per-command basis.  It is not a replacement for the shell.  Features
include: the ability to restrict what commands a user may run on a
per-host basis, copious logging of each command (providing a clear
audit trail of who did what), a configurable timeout of the sudo
command, and the ability to use the same configuration file (sudoers)

Utilities to convert timezone database files.
A high-performance email, contacts and calendar server.
Cyrus IMAP server administration utilities.","
vzic is a program to convert the Olson timezone database files into VTIMEZONE
files compatible with the iCalendar specification (RFC2445).

This package contains a forked version of vzic for internal use by the Cyrus
IMAP server.
The Cyrus IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) server provides access to
personal mail, system-wide bulletin boards, news-feeds, calendar and contacts
through the IMAP, JMAP, NNTP, CalDAV and CardDAV protocols. The Cyrus IMAP
server is a scalable enterprise groupware system designed for use from small to
large enterprise environments using technologies based on well-established Open
Standards.

A full Cyrus IMAP implementation allows a seamless mail and bulletin board
environment to be set up across one or more nodes. It differs from other IMAP
server implementations in that it is run on sealed nodes, where users are not
normally permitted to log in. The mailbox database is stored in parts of the
filesystem that are private to the Cyrus IMAP system. All user access to mail
is through software using the IMAP, IMAPS, JMAP, POP3, POP3S, KPOP, CalDAV
and/or CardDAV protocols.

The private mailbox database design gives the Cyrus IMAP server large
advantages in efficiency, scalability, and administratability. Multiple
concurrent read/write connections to the same mailbox are permitted. The server
supports access control lists on mailboxes and storage quotas on mailbox
hierarchies.

Cyrus IMAP server. It can be installed on systems other than the
one running the server.",imap timezone utilities ,imap mailbox cyrus protocols vzic ,server utilities convert ,imap server cyrus mailbox access ,2,系统库

Google Roboto Slab fonts.","
Roboto has a dual nature. It has a mechanical skeleton and the forms are
largely geometric. At the same time, the font features friendly and open
curves. While some grotesks distort their letterforms to force a rigid
rhythm, Roboto doesn't compromise, allowing letters to be settled into
their natural width. This makes for a more natural reading rhythm more
commonly found in humanist and serif types.

This is the Roboto Slab family, which can be used alongside the normal
Roboto family and the Roboto Condensed family.",fonts roboto slab ,roboto grotesks letterforms rhythm mechanical ,google roboto slab ,roboto rhythm natural commonly rigid ,3,字体

A sanserif typeface family.","
Lato is a sanserif typeface family designed in the Summer 2010 by Warsaw-based
designer Łukasz Dziedzic (""Lato"" means ""Summer"" in Polish). In December 2010 the
Lato family was published under the open-source Open Font License by his foundry
tyPoland, with support from Google.

When working on Lato, Łukasz tried to carefully balance some potentially
conflicting priorities. He wanted to create a typeface that would seem quite
""transparent"" when used in body text but would display some original treats when
used in larger sizes. He used classical proportions (particularly visible in the
uppercase) to give the letterforms familiar harmony and elegance. At the same
time, he created a sleek sanserif look, which makes evident the fact that Lato
was designed in 2010 - even though it does not follow any current trend.

The semi-rounded details of the letters give Lato a feeling of warmth, while the
strong structure provides stability and seriousness. ""Male and female, serious
but friendly. With the feeling of the Summer,"" says Łukasz.

Lato consists of nine weights (plus corresponding italics), including a
beautiful hairline style. It covers 2300+ glyphs per style and supports 100+
Latin-based languages, 50+ Cyrillic-based languages as well as Greek and IPA
phonetics.",sanserif typeface family ,lato typeface łukasz sanserif sleek ,sanserif typeface family ,lato give design łukasz support ,3,字体

The PT Sans family was developed as part of the “Public Types of Russian
Federation” project. This project aims at enabling the peoples of Russia to
read and write their native languages, using free/libre fonts. It is
dedicated to the 300-year anniversary of the Russian civil type invented by
Peter the Great from 1708 to 1710, and was realized with financial support
from the Russian Federal Agency for Press and Mass Communications.

The fonts include support for all 54 title¹ languages of the Russian
Federation as well as more common Western, Central European and Cyrillic
blocks making them unique and a very important tool for modern digital
communications.

PT Sans is a grotesque font based on Russian type designs of the second part
of the 20th century. However, it also includes very distinctive features of
modern humanistic design, fulfilling present day aesthetic and functional
requirements.

It was designed by Alexandra Korolkova, Olga Umpeleva and Vladimir Yefimov
and released by ParaType.

¹ A “title” language is named after an ethnic group.

This package includes 2 captions styles for small text sizes.

The TeX Live software distribution offers a complete TeX system for a
variety of Unix, Macintosh, Windows and other platforms. It
encompasses programs for editing, typesetting, previewing and printing
of TeX documents in many different languages, and a large collection
of TeX macros and font libraries.

The distribution includes extensive general documentation about TeX,
as well as the documentation for the included software packages.
adjustbox package
A set of virtual fonts which emulates T1 coded fonts using the
standard CM fonts. The package name, AE fonts, supposedly
stands for ""Almost European"". The main use of the package was
to produce PDF files using Adobe Type 1 versions of the CM
fonts instead of bitmapped EC fonts. Note that direct
substitutes for the bitmapped EC fonts are now available, via
the CM-super, Latin Modern and (in a restricted way) CM-LGC
font sets.
Consists of two environments: algorithm and algorithmic. The
algorithm package defines a floating algorithm environment
designed to work with the algorithmic style. Within an
algorithmic environment a number of commands for typesetting
popular algorithmic constructs are available.
This bundle contains three AMS classes, amsart (for writing
articles for the AMS), amsbook (for books) and amsproc (for
proceedings), together with some supporting material. The
material is made available as part of the AMS-LaTeX
distribution.
The package provides the principal packages in the AMS-LaTeX
distribution. It adapts for use in LaTeX most of the
mathematical features found in AMS-TeX; it is highly
recommendsd as an adjunct to serious mathematical typesetting
in LaTeX. When amsmath is loaded, AMS-LaTeX packages amsbsy
(for bold symbols), amsopn (for operator names) and amstext
(for text embdedded in mathematics) are also loaded. Amsmath is
part of the LaTeX required distribution; however, several
contributed packages add still further to its appeal; examples
are empheq, which provides functions for decorating and
highlighting mathematics, and ntheorem, for specifying theorem
(and similar) definitions.
The package allows the to user select any font size (via e.g.
\fontsize{...}{...}\selectfont), even those sizes that are not
listed in the .fd file. If such a size is requested, LaTeX will
search for and select the nearest listed size; anyfontsize will
then scale the font to the size actually requested. Similar
functionality is available for the CM family, for the EC
family, or for either computer modern encoding; the present
package generalises the facility.
This package is considered obsolete; alternatives are the
typearea package from the koma-script bundle, or the geometry
package.
The appendix package provides various ways of formatting the
titles of appendices. Also (sub)appendices environments are
provided that can be used, for example, for per chapter/section
appendices. The word `Appendix' or similar can be prepended to
the appendix number for article class documents. The word
`Appendices' or similar can be added to the table of contents
before the appendices are listed. The word `Appendices' or
similar can be typeset as a \part-like heading (page) in the
body. An appendices environment is provided which can be used
instead of the \appendix command.
ArabXeTeX provides a convenient ArabTeX-like user-interface for
typesetting languages using the Arabic script in XeLaTeX, with
flexible access to font features. Input in ArabTeX notation can
be set in three different vocalization modes or in roman
transliteration. Direct UTF-8 input is also supported. The
parsing and converting of ArabTeX input to Unicode is done by
means of TECkit mappings. Version 1.0 provides support for
Arabic, Maghribi Arabic, Farsi (Persian), Urdu, Sindhi,
Kashmiri, Ottoman Turkish, Kurdish, Jawi (Malay) and Uighur.
The documentation (not yet complete) covers topics such as
typesetting the Holy Quran, typesetting bidirectional critical
editions (with ednotes), and information on various recommended
OpenType fonts for the Arabic script and for transliterating
Oriental languages.
These are font bundles for the Chinese Arphic fonts which work
with the CJK package. Arphic is actually the name of the
company that which created the fonts (and put them under a GPL-
like licence).
Starting with PDF 1.3 (Adobe Acrobat 4.0), PDF files can
contain file attachments -- arbitrary files that a reader can
extract, just like attachments to an e-mail message. The
attachfile package brings this functionality to pdfLaTeX and
provides some additional features not available in Acrobat,
such as the ability to use arbitrary LaTeX code for the file
icon -- including things like \includegraphics, tabular, and
mathematics. Settings can be made either globally or on a per-
attachment basis. Attachfile makes it easy to attach files and
customize their appearance in the enclosing document. The
package supports the Created, Modified, and Size keys in the
EmbeddedFile's Params dictionary.
A set of fonts for use as ""drop-in"" replacements for Adobe's
basic set, comprising: - Century Schoolbook (substituting for
Adobe's New Century Schoolbook); - Dingbats (substituting for
Adobe's Zapf Dingbats); - Nimbus Mono L (substituting for
Abobe's Courier); - Nimbus Roman No9 L (substituting for
Adobe's Times); - Nimbus Sans L (substituting for Adobe's
Helvetica); - Standard Symbols L (substituting for Adobe's
Symbol); - URW Bookman; - URW Chancery L Medium Italic
(substituting for Adobe's Zapf Chancery); - URW Gothic L Book
(substituting for Adobe's Avant Garde); and - URW Palladio L
(substituting for Adobe's Palatino).
Awesome Boxes is all about drawing admonition blocks around
text to inform or alert readers about something particular. The
specific aim of this package is to use FontAwesome icons to
ease the illustration of these blocks. This package requires
FontAwesome and XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX.
The package manages culturally-determined typographical (and
other) rules, and hyphenation patterns for a wide range of
languages. A document may select a single language to be
supported, or it may select several, in which case the document
may switch from one language to another in a variety of ways.
Note that the package has contributions for several languages
that remain to be incorporated. Examples are: Arabic; Magyar
(Hungarian); Serbian written in cyrillic; Spanish; and Spanish,
using Mexican conventions.. Users of XeTeX are advised to use
polyglossia rather than Babel.
The package provides the language definition file for support
of English in babel. Care is taken to select british
hyphenation patterns for British English and Australian text,
and default ('american') patterns for Canadian and USA text.
This package enables to generate multilingual bibliographies in
cooperation with babel. Two approaches are possible: Each
citation may be written in another language, or the whole
bibliography can be typeset in a language chosen by the user.
In addition, the package supports commands to change the
typography of the bibliographies.
The beamer LaTeX class can be used for producing slides. Its
functionality is similar to Prosper but does not need any
external programs and can directly produce a presentation using
pdflatex. Beamer uses pgf for pdf/ps independent graphics.
Frames are created using \frame{...}, and a frame can build
multiple slides through a simple notation for specifying
material for each slide within a frame. Beamer supports
bibliographies, appendicies and transitions. Short versions of
title, authors, institute can also be specified as optional
parameters. A \plainframe{} allows a picture, for example, to
fill the whole frame. Support figure and table environments,
transparency effects, a \transduration command, animation
commands, a pauses environment. Beamer also provides
compatibility with other packages like prosper. The package now
incorporates the functionality of the former translator
package, which is used for customising the package for use in
other language environments.
The package contains the Bera Type 1 fonts, and a zip archive
containing files to use the fonts with LaTeX. Bera is a set of
three font families: Bera Serif (a slab-serif Roman), Bera Sans
(a Frutiger descendant), and Bera Mono (monospaced/typewriter).
Support for use in LaTeX is also provided. The Bera family is a
repackaging, for use with TeX, of the Bitstream Vera family.
Typeset a LaTeX2e document with the Concrete fonts designed by
Don Knuth and used in his book ""Concrete Mathematics"".
BibTeX allows the user to store his citation data in generic
form, while printing citations in a document in the form
specified by a BibTeX style, to be specified in the document
itself (one often needs a LaTeX citation-style package, such as
natbib as well). BibTeX itself is an ASCII-only program; there
is, however, a version that copes with 8-bit character sets.
However, BibTeX's facilities rapidly run out as one moves away
from simple ASCII (for example, in the various national sorting
rules for languages expressed in different parts of ISO-8859 --
the ""ISO Latin"" series). For more flexibility, the user is
urged to consider using biber with biblatex to typeset its
output. In particular, it is best to avoid BibTeX in favour of
biblatex, if at all possible.
The package allows the user to include several bibliographies
covering different 'topics' or bibliographic material into a
document (e.g., one bibliography for primary literature and one
for secondary literature). The package provides commands to
include either all references from a .bib file, only the
references actually cited or those not cited in your document.
The user has to construct a separate .bib file for each
bibliographic 'topic', each of which will be processed
separately by BibTeX. If you want to have bibliographies
specific to one part of a document, see the packages bibunits
or chapterbib.
A convenient interface for typesetting bidirectional texts with
plain TeX and LaTeX. The package includes adaptations for use
with many other commonly-used packages.
The package aims to provide a 'one-stop' solution to
requirements for footnotes. It offers: - Multiple footnote
apparatus superior to that of the manyfoot; - Footnotes can be
formatted in separate paragraphs, or be run into a single
paragraph (this choice may be selected per footnote series); -
Things you might have expected (like \verb-like material in
footnotes, and colour selections over page breaks) now work.
Note that the majority of the bigfoot package's interface is
identical to that of manyfoot; users should seek information
from that package's documentation. The bigfoot bundle also
provides the perpage and suffix packages.
A set of fonts for use as ""drop-in"" replacements for Adobe's
basic set, comprising: - Century Schoolbook (substituting for
Adobe's New Century Schoolbook); - Dingbats (substituting for
Adobe's Zapf Dingbats); - Nimbus Mono L (substituting for
Abobe's Courier); - Nimbus Roman No9 L (substituting for
Adobe's Times); - Nimbus Sans L (substituting for Adobe's
Helvetica); - Standard Symbols L (substituting for Adobe's
Symbol); - URW Bookman; - URW Chancery L Medium Italic
(substituting for Adobe's Zapf Chancery); - URW Gothic L Book
(substituting for Adobe's Avant Garde); and - URW Palladio L
(substituting for Adobe's Palatino).
The package enhances the quality of tables in LaTeX, providing
extra commands as well as behind-the-scenes optimisation.
Guidelines are given as to what constitutes a good table in
this context. From version 1.61, the package offers longtable
compatibility.
This package provides a command much like hyperref's \url that
typesets a URL using a typewriter-like font. However, if the
dvips driver is being used, the original \url doesn't allow
line breaks in the middle of the created link: the link comes
in one atomic piece. This package allows such line breaks in
the generated links.
The package provides solutions to a number of common
difficulties in writing displayed equations and getting high-
quality output. For example, it is a well-known inconvenience
that if an equation must be broken into more than one line,
'left...right' constructs cannot span lines. The breqn package
makes them work as one would expect whether or not there is an
intervening line break. The single most ambitious goal of the
package, however, is to support automatic linebreaking of
displayed equations. Such linebreaking cannot be done without
substantial changes under the hood in the way formulae are
processed; the code must be watched carefully, keeping an eye
on possible glitches. The bundle also contains the flexisym and
mathstyle packages, which are both designated as support for
breqn.
Defines a command \captionof for putting a caption to something
that's not a float. Note that the caption package includes a
\captionof command that is an extension of that provided by
this package.
The caption package provides many ways to customise the
captions in floating environments like figure and table, and
cooperates with many other packages. Facilities include
rotating captions, sideways captions, continued captions (for
tables or figures that come in several parts). A list of
compatibility notes, for other packages, is provided in the
documentation. The package also provides the ""caption outside
float"" facility, in the same way that simpler packages like
capt-of do. The package supersedes caption2.
Many of David Carlisle's more substantial packages stand on
their own, or as part of the LaTeX tools set; this set
contains: - Making dotless 'j' characters for fonts that don't
have them; - Fix marks in 2-column output; - A method for
combining the capabilities of longtable and tabularx; - A
proforma for building personalised LaTeX formats; - A jiffy to
suppress page numbers; - An environment for including Plain TeX
in LaTeX documents; - A jiffy to remove counters from other
counters' reset lists; - A package to rescale fonts to
arbitrary sizes; - A jiffy to create 'slashed' for physicists;
and - An environment for including HTML in LaTeX documents.
Identify areas of text to be marked with changebars with the
\cbstart and \cbend commands; the bars may be coloured. The
package uses 'drivers' to place the bars; the available drivers
can work with dvitoln03, dvitops, dvips, the emTeX and TeXtures
DVI drivers, and VTeX and PDFTeX.
The package provides commands to change the page layout in the
middle of a document, and to robustly check for typesetting on
odd or even pages. Instructions for use are at the end of the
file. The package is an extraction of code from the memoir
class, whose user interface it shares. It is intended the this
package will eventually replace the chngpage package, which is
distributed with the package.
A commercial text font donated for the common good. Support for
use with LaTeX is available in freenfss, part of psnfss.
Defines commands \counterwithin (which sets up a counter to be
reset when another is incremented) and \counterwithout (which
unsets such a relationship).
The package supports compressed, sorted lists of numerical
citations, and also deals with various punctuation and other
issues of representation, including comprehensive management of
break points. The package is compatible with both hyperref and
backref. The package is (unsurprisingly) part of the cite
bundle of the author's citation-related packages.
CJK is a macro package for LaTeX, providing simultaneous
support for various Asian scripts in many encodings (including
Unicode): - Chinese (both traditional and simplified), -
Japanese, - Korean and - Thai. A special add-on feature is an
interface to the Emacs editor (cjk-enc.el) which gives
simultaneous, easy-to-use support to a bunch of other scripts
in addition to the above: - Cyrillic, - Greek, - Latin-based
scripts, - Russian and - Vietnamese.
The package provides an experiment in using XML (specifically
DocBook 5) to mark up and maintain LaTeX classes and packages.
XSLT 2 styleheets generate the .dtx and .ins distribution files
expected by end users.
The fonts are converted from Metafont sources of the Computer
Modern font families, using textrace. Supported encodings are:
T1 (Latin), T2A (Cyrillic), LGR (Greek) and TS1. The package
also includes Unicode virtual fonts for use with Omega. The
font set is not a replacement for any of the other Computer
Modern-based font sets (for example, cm-super for Latin and
Cyrillic, or cbgreek for Greek), since it is available at a
single size only; it offers a compact set for 'general'
working. The fonts themselves are encoded to external
standards, and virtual fonts are provided for use with TeX.
CM-Super family of fonts are Adobe Type 1 fonts that replace
the T1/TS1-encoded Computer Modern (EC/TC), T1/TS1-encoded
Concrete, T1/TS1-encoded CM bright and LH fonts (thus
supporting all European languages except Greek, and all
Cyrillic-based languages), and bringing many ameliorations in
typesetting quality. The fonts exhibit the same metrics as the
MetaFont-encoded originals.

The package allows rows and columns to be coloured, and even
individual cells.
A full featured, parameter driven macro package, which fully
supports advanced interactive documents. See the ConTeXt garden
for a wealth of support information.
A set of fonts for use as ""drop-in"" replacements for Adobe's
basic set, comprising: - Century Schoolbook (substituting for
Adobe's New Century Schoolbook); - Dingbats (substituting for
Adobe's Zapf Dingbats); - Nimbus Mono L (substituting for
Abobe's Courier); - Nimbus Roman No9 L (substituting for
Adobe's Times); - Nimbus Sans L (substituting for Adobe's
Helvetica); - Standard Symbols L (substituting for Adobe's
Symbol); - URW Bookman; - URW Chancery L Medium Italic
(substituting for Adobe's Zapf Chancery); - URW Gothic L Book
(substituting for Adobe's Avant Garde); and - URW Palladio L
(substituting for Adobe's Palatino).
A package providing corner marks for camera alignment as well
as for trimming paper stacks, and additional page information
on every page if required. Most macros are easily adaptable to
personal preferences. An option is provided for selectively
suppressing graphics or text, which may be useful for printing
just colour graphics on a colour laser printer and the rest on
a cheap mono laser printer. A page info line contains the time
and a new cropmarks index and is printed at the top of the
page. A configuration command is provided for the info line
font. Options for better collaboration with dvips, pdftex and
vtex are provided.
This package provides advanced facilities for inline and
display quotations. It is designed for a wide range of tasks
ranging from the most simple applications to the more complex
demands of formal quotations. The facilities include commands,
environments, and user-definable 'smart quotes' which
dynamically adjust to their context. Quotation marks are
switched automatically if quotations are nested and they can be
adjusted to the current language if the babel package is
available. There are additional facilities designed to cope
with the more specific demands of academic writing, especially
in the humanities and the social sciences. All quote styles as
well as the optional active quotes are freely configurable. The
package is dependent on e-TeX, and requires the author's
etoolbox package.
Provides commands to typeset centered, left- or right-aligned
table and (multiple-)figure floats, with footnotes. Instead of
an environment, a command with 4 arguments is used; the first
is optional and is used for key,value pairs generating
variations on the defaults and offering a route for future
extensions.
This package provides a method for defining category code table
stacks in LuaTeX. It builds on code provided by the 2015/10/01
release of LaTeX2e (also available as ltluatex.sty for plain
users). It is required by the luatexbase package (v1.0 onward)
which uses ctablestack to provide a back-compatibility form of
this concept.
The package provides macros holding file name information
(directory, base name, extension, full name and full path) for
files read by LaTeX \input and \include macros; it uses the
file hooks provided by the author's filehook. In particular, it
restores the parent file name after the trailing \clearpage of
an \included file; as a result, the macros may be usefully
employed in the page header and footer of the last printed page
of such a file. The depth of inclusion is made available,
together with the ""parent"" (including file) and ""parents"" (all
including files to the root of the tree). The package
supersedes FiNK.
Provides various different formats for the text created by the
command \today, and also provides commands for displaying the
current time (or any given time), in 12-hour, 24-hour or text
format. The package overrides babel's date format, having its
own library of date formats in different languages. The package
requires the fmtcount package.
Dvipdfmx (formerly dvipdfm-cjk) is a development of dvipdfm
created to support multi-byte character encodings and large
character sets for East Asian languages. Dvipdfmx, if ""called""
with the name dvipdfm, operates in a ""dvipdfm compatibility""
mode, so that users of the both packages need only keep one
executable. A secondary design goal is to support as many ""PDF""
features as does pdfTeX. There being no documentation as such,
users are advised to consult the documentation of dvipdfm (as
well, of course, as the package Readme.
This program makes PNG and/or GIF graphics from DVI files as
obtained from TeX and its relatives. Its benefits include: -
Speed. It offers very fast rendering of DVI as bitmap files,
which makes it suitable for generating large amounts of images
on-the-fly, as needed in preview-latex, WeBWorK and others; -
It does not read the postamble, so it can be started before TeX
finishes. There is a --follow switch that makes dvipng wait at
end-of-file for further output, unless it finds the POST marker
that indicates the end of the DVI; - Interactive query of
options. dvipng can read options interactively through stdin,
and all options are usable. It is even possible to change the
input file through this interface. - Support for PK, VF,
PostScript Type1, and TrueType fonts, colour specials, and
inclusion of PostScript, PNG, JPEG or GIF images.
This package has been withdrawn from CTAN, and bundled into the
distributions' package sets. The current sources of dvips may
be found in the distribution of dvipsk which forms part of the
TeX-live sources.
Dvisvgm is a command line utility that converts TeX DVI files
to the XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. It
provides full font support including virtual fonts, font maps,
and sub-fonts. If necessary, dvisvgm vectorizes Metafont's
bitmap output in order to always create lossless scalable
output. The embedded SVG fonts can optionally be replaced with
graphics paths so that applications that don't support SVG
fonts are enabled to render the graphics properly. Besides many
other features, dvisvgm also supports color, emTeX, tpic, PDF
mapfile and PostScript specials. Users will need a working TeX
installation including the kpathsea library. For more detailed
information, see the project page.
The EC fonts are European Computer Modern Fonts, supporting the
complete LaTeX T1 encoding defined at the 1990 TUG conference
hold at Cork/Ireland. These fonts are intended to be stable
with no changes being made to the tfm files. The set also
contains a Text Companion Symbol font, called tc, featuring
many useful characters needed in text typesetting, for example
oldstyle digits, currency symbols (including the newly created
Euro symbol), the permille sign, copyright, trade mark and
servicemark as well as a copyleft sign, and many others. Recent
releases of LaTeX2e support the EC fonts. The EC fonts
supersede the preliminary version released as the DC fonts. The
fonts are available in (traced) Adobe Type 1 format, as part of
the cm-super bundle. The other Computer Modern-style T1-encoded
Type 1 set, Latin Modern, is not actually a direct development
of the EC set, and differs from the EC in a number of
particulars.
Extensions to epic and the LaTeX picture drawing environment,
include the drawing of lines at any slope, the drawing of
circles in any radii, and the drawing of dotted and dashed
lines much faster with much less TeX memory, and providing
several new commands for drawing ellipses, arcs, splines, and
filled circles and ellipses. The package uses tpic \special
commands.
EncTeX is (another) tex extension, written at the change-file
level. It provides means of translating input on the way into
TeX. It allows, for example, translation of multibyte
sequences, such as utf-8 encoding.
This package provides user control over the layout of the three
basic list environments: enumerate, itemize and description. It
supersedes both enumerate and mdwlist (providing well-
structured replacements for all their funtionality), and in
addition provides functions to compute the layout of labels,
and to 'clone' the standard environments, to create new
environments with counters of their own.
The package provides the \collect@body command (as in amsmath),
as well as a \long version \Collect@Body, for collecting the
body text of an environment. These commands are used to define
a new author interface to creating new environments. For
example: \NewEnviron{test} wraps the entire environment body in
square brackets, doing the right thing in ignoring leading and
trailing spaces.
The original graphics inclusion macros for use with dvips;
still widely used by Plain TeX users (in particular). For LaTeX
users, the package is nowadays deprecated in favour of the more
sophisticated standard LaTeX graphics bundle of packages (which
are also available to Plain TeX users, either via its Plain TeX
version, or through the support offered by etex).
Epstopdf is a Perl script that converts an EPS file to an
'encapsulated' PDF file (a single page file whose media box is
the same as the original EPS's bounding box). The resulting
file suitable for inclusion by PDFTeX as an image. The script
is adapted to run both on Windows and on Unix-alike systems.
The script makes use of Ghostscript for the actual conversion
to PDF. It assumes Ghostscript version 6.51 or later, and (by
default) suppresses its automatic rotation of pages where most
of the text is not horizontal. LaTeX users may make use of the
epstopdf package, which will run the epstopdf script ""on the
fly"", thus giving the illusion that PDFLaTeX is accepting EPS
graphic files.
LaTeX users sometimes need to ensure that two or more blocks of
text occupy the same amount of horizontal space on the page. To
that end, the eqparbox package defines a new command,
\eqparbox, which works just like \parbox, except that instead
of specifying a width, one specifies a tag. All eqparboxes with
the same tag--regardless of where they are in the document--
will stretch to fit the widest eqparbox with that tag. This
simple, equal-width mechanism can be used for a variety of
alignment purposes, as is evidenced by the examples in
eqparbox's documentation. Various derivatives of \eqparbox are
also provided.
Eso-pic is an extension of everyshi. Using everyshi's
\EveryShipout command, eso-pic adds one or more user commands
to LaTeX's shipout actions.
The package provides a straightforward interface to many of the
extensions offered by e-TeX; in particular, it modifies LaTeX's
register allocation macros to make use of the extended register
range. The etoolbox and etextools packages provide macros that
make more sophisticated use of e-TeX's facilities.
The etoolbox package is a toolbox of programming facilities
geared primarily towards LaTeX class and package authors. It
provides LaTeX frontends to some of the new primitives provided
by e-TeX as well as some generic tools which are not strictly
related to e-TeX but match the profile of this package. Note
that the initial versions of this package were released under
the name elatex. The package provides functions that seem to
offer alternative ways of implementing some LaTeX kernel
commands; nevertheless, the package will not modify any part of
the LaTeX kernel.
Font encoding definitions for unicode fonts loaded by LaTeX in
XeTeX or LuaTeX. The package provides two encodings: -- EU1,
designed for use with XeTeX, which the fontspec uses for
unicode fonts which require no macro-level processing for
accents, and -- EU2, which provides the same facilities for use
with LuaTeX. Neither encoding places any restriction on the
glyphs provided by a font; use of EU2 causes the package
euxunicode to be loaded (the package is part of this
distribution). The package includes font definition files for
use with the Latin Modern OpenType fonts.
Provides a setup for using the AMS Euler family of fonts for
mathematics in LaTeX documents. ""The underlying philosophy of
Zapf's Euler design was to capture the flavour of mathematics
as it might be written by a mathematician with excellent
handwriting."" [concrete-tug] The euler package is based on
Knuth's macros for the book 'Concrete Mathematics'. The text
fonts for the Concrete book are supported by the beton package.
Converts arbitrary national currency amounts using the Euro as
base unit, and typesets monetary amounts in almost any desired
way. Write, e.g., \ATS{17.6} to get something like '17,60 oS
(1,28 Euro)' automatically. Conversion rates for the initial
Euro-zone countries are already built-in. Further rates can be
added easily. The package uses the fp package to do its sums.
The new European currency symbol for the Euro implemented in
MetaFont, using the official European Commission dimensions,
and providing several shapes (normal, slanted, bold, outline).
The package also includes a LaTeX package which defines the
macro, pre-compiled tfm files, and documentation.
Provides classes extarticle and extreport, extletter, extbook,
extproc which allow for documents with a base font of size 8-
20pt.
Provides variants of \fbox: \shadowbox, \doublebox, \ovalbox,
\Ovalbox, with helpful tools for using box macros and flexible
verbatim macros. You can box mathematics, floats, center,
flushleft, and flushright, lists, and pages.
The package provides extensive facilities, both for
constructing headers and footers, and for controlling their use
(for example, at times when LaTeX would automatically change
the heading style in use).
Provides fancy cross-referencing support, based on the
package's reference commands (\fref and \Fref) that recognise
what sort of object is being referenced. So, for example, the
label for a \section would be expected to be of the form
'sec:foo': the package would recognise the 'sec:' part.
Flexible handling of verbatim text including: verbatim commands
in footnotes; a variety of verbatim environments with many
parameters; ability to define new customized verbatim
environments; save and restore verbatim text and environments;
write and read files in verbatim mode; build ""example""
environments (showing both result and verbatim source).
LaTeX2e's filecontents and filecontents* environments enable a
LaTeX source file to generate external files as it runs through
LaTeX. However, there are two limitations of these
environments: they refuse to overwrite existing files, and they
can only be used in the preamble of a document. The
filecontents package removes these limitations, letting you
overwrite existing files and letting you use
filecontents/filecontents* anywhere.
The package provides several file hooks (AtBegin, AtEnd, ...)
for files read by \input, \include and \InputIfFileExists.
General hooks for all such files (e.g. all \include'd ones) and
file specific hooks only used for named files are provided; two
hooks are provided for the end of \included files -- one
before, and one after the final \clearpage.
The LaTeX internal command \@finalstrut is used automatically
used at the end of footnote texts to insert a strut to avoid
mis-spacing of multiple footnotes. Unfortunately the command
can cause a blank line at the end of a footnote. The package
provides a solution to this problem.
Fix mark handling so that \firstmark is taken from the first
column if that column has any marks at all; keep two column
floats like figure* in sequence with single column floats like
figure.
The package offers improvement of the Latvian language support
in polyglossia, in particular in the area of the standard
classes.
Impro
An extended set of fonts for use in mathematics, including:
extra mathematical symbols; blackboard bold letters (uppercase
only); fraktur letters; subscript sizes of bold math italic and
bold Greek letters; subscript sizes of large symbols such as
sum and product; added sizes of the Computer Modern small caps
font; cyrillic fonts (from the University of Washington); Euler
mathematical fonts. All fonts are provided as Adobe Type 1
files, and all except the Euler fonts are provided as Metafont
source. The distribution also includes the canonical Type 1
versions of the Computer Modern family of fonts. Plain TeX and
LaTeX macros for using the fonts are provided.
TeX Live licenses shipped in text form.
Knuth's final iteration of his re-interpretation of a c.19
Modern-style font from Monotype. The family is comprehensive,
offering both sans and roman styles, and a monospaced font,
together with mathematics fonts closely integrated with the
mathematical facilities of TeX itself. The base fonts are
distributed as Metafont source, but autotraced PostScript Type
1 versions are available (one version in the AMS fonts
distribution, and also the BaKoMa distribution). The Computer
Modern fonts have inspired many later families, notably the
European Computer Modern and the Latin Modern families.
These files are regarded as basic for any TeX system, covering
plain TeX macros, Computer Modern fonts, and configuration for
common drivers; no LaTeX.
Recommended fonts, including the base 35 PostScript fonts,
Latin Modern, TeX Gyre, and T1 and other encoding support for
Computer Modern, in outline form.
These packages are mandated by the core LaTeX team, or at least
very strongly recommended.
A collection of recommended add-on packages for LaTeX which
have widespread use.
An extended version of TeX (which is capable of running as if
it were TeX unmodified). E-TeX has been specified by the LaTeX
team as the engine for the development of LaTeX, in the
immediate future; as a result, LaTeX programmers may (in all
current TeX distributions) assume e-TeX functionality.
glyphlist package
This bundle includes color.cfg and graphics.cfg files that set
default ""driver"" options for the color and graphics packages.
It contains support for defaulting the new LuaTeX option which
was added to graphics and color in the 2016-02-01 release. The
LuaTeX option is only used for LuaTeX versions from 0.87, older
versions use the pdfTeX option as before.
This bundle is a combined distribution consisting of dvips.def,
pdftex.def, luatex.def, xetex.def, dvipdfmx.def, and
dvisvgm.def driver option files for the LaTeX graphics and
color packages. It is hoped that by combining their source
repositories at https://github.com/latex3/graphics-def it will
be easier to coordinate updates.
Designed for use with xdvi and dvips this utility converts
Adobe Type 1 fonts to PK bitmap format. It should not
ordinarily be much used nowadays, since both its target
applications are now capable of dealing with Type 1 fonts,
direct.
hyphen-base package
A collection of miscellaneous MetaFont source, including the
means to generate the logo font that is used for MetaFont and
MetaPost.
Kpathsea is a library and utility programs which provide path
searching facilities for TeX file types, including the self-
locating feature required for movable installations, layered on
top of a general search mechanism. It is not distributed
separately, but rather is released and maintained as part of
the TeX live sources.
LaTeX is a widely-used macro package for TeX, providing many
basic document formating commands extended by a wide range of
packages. It is a development of Leslie Lamport's original
LaTeX 2.09, and superseded the older system in June 1994. The
basic distribution is catalogued separately, at latex-base;
apart from a large set of contributed packages and third-party
documentation (elsewhere on the archive), the distribution
includes: - a bunch of required packages, which LaTeX authors
are ""entitled to assume"" will be present on any system running
LaTeX; and - a minimal set of documentation detailing
differences from the 'old' version of LaTeX in the areas of
user commands, font selection and control, class and package
writing, font encodings, configuration options and modification
of LaTeX. For downloading details, see the linked catalogue
entries above.
This is a collection of fonts for use with standard latex
packages and classes. It includes 'invisible' fonts (for use
with the slides class), line and circle fonts (for use in the
picture environment) and 'latex symbol' fonts. For full support
of a latex installation, some Computer Modern font variants
cmbsy(6-9), cmcsc(8,9), cmex(7-9) and cmmib(5-9) from the
amsfonts distribution, are also necessary. The fonts are
available as Metafont source, and metric (tfm) files are also
provided. Most of the fonts are also available in Adobe Type 1
format, in the amsfonts distribution.
latexconfig package
The Latin Modern family of fonts consists of 72 text fonts and
20 mathematics fonts, and is based on the Computer Modern fonts
released into public domain by AMS (copyright (c) 1997 AMS).
The lm font set contains a lot of additional characters, mainly
accented ones, but not exclusively. There is one set of fonts,
available both in Adobe Type 1 format (*.pfb) and in OpenType
format (*.otf). There are five sets of TeX Font Metric files,
corresponding to: Cork encoding (cork-*.tfm); QX encoding (qx-
*.tfm); TeX'n'ANSI aka LY1 encoding (texnansi-*.tfm); T5
(Vietnamese) encoding (t5-*.tfm); and Text Companion for EC
fonts aka TS1 (ts1-*.tfm).
Latin Modern Math is a maths companion for the Latin Modern
family of fonts, in OpenType format. For use with LuaLaTeX or
XeLaTeX, support is available from the unicode-math package.
lua_altgetopt is a MIT-licensed module for Lua, for processing
application arguments in the same way as BSD/GNU getopt_long(3)
functions do. This module is made available for lua script
writers to have consistent command line parsing routines.
Lualibs is a collection of Lua modules useful for general
programming. The bundle is based on lua modules shipped with
ConTeXt, and are made available in this bundle for use
independent of ConTeXt.
LuaTeX is an extended version of pdfTeX using Lua as an
embedded scripting language. The LuaTeX project's main
objective is to provide an open and configurable variant of TeX
while at the same time offering downward compatibility. LuaTeX
uses Unicode (as UTF-8) as its default input encoding, and is
able to use modern (OpenType) fonts (for both text and
mathematics). It should be noted that LuaTeX is still under
development; its specification has been declared stable, but
absolute stability may not in practice be assumed.
manfnt-font package
MetaPost uses a language based on that of Metafont to produce
precise technical illustrations. Its output is scalable
PostScript or SVG, rather than the bitmaps Metafont creates.
These fonts were created in Metafont by Knuth, for his own
publications. At some stage, the letters 'P' and 'S' were
added, so that the MetaPost logo could also be expressed. The
fonts were originally issued (of course) as Metafont source;
they have since been autotraced and reissued in Adobe Type 1
format by Taco Hoekwater.
The mptopdf script does standalone conversion from mpost to
PDF, using the supp-* and syst-* files.  They also allow native
MetaPost graphics inclusion in LaTeX (via pdftex.def) and
ConTeXt.  They can be used independently of the rest of
ConTeXt, yet are maintained as part of it.  So in TeX Live we
pull them out to this separate package for the benefit of LaTeX
users who do not install the rest of ConTeXt.  This can be
found on CTAN in macros/pdftex/graphics.
An extension of TeX which can be configured to directly
generate PDF documents instead of DVI. All current free TeX
distributionsm including TeX live, MacTeX and MiKTeX include
pdfTeX (Plain TeX) and pdfLaTeX (LaTeX). ConTeXt was designed
around use of pdfTeX (though it is now migrating towards
LuaTeX).
Contains files used to build the Plain TeX format, as described
in the TeXbook, together with various supporting files (some
also discussed in the book).
This package has all the code from the package pstricks-add
which was related to arrows, like multiple arrows and so on.
The package provides helper functions for other PSTricks
related packages.
This is the basic TeX Live scheme: it is a small set of files
sufficient to typeset plain TeX or LaTeX documents in
PostScript or PDF, using the Computer Modern fonts.  This
scheme corresponds to collection-basic and collection-latex.
The fonts were originally distributed as MetaFont sources only,
but Adobe Type 1 versions are also now available. Macro support
is provided for use under LaTeX; the package supports the
""only"" option (provided by the somedefs package) to restrict
what is loaded, for those who don't need the whole font.
teTeX was a comprehensive distribution of TeX, LaTeX and
family, designed for ease of compilation, installation and
customisation. In 2006, Thomas Esser announced he would no
longer be able to support, or to produce new versions of,
teTeX. With the appearance of TeX live 2007 (whose Unix-system
TeX support originally derived from teTeX), no-one should be
using teTeX at all, in new applications. One of the ""schemes""
available when installing TeX live provides a configuration
very close to that of the old teTeX, but using modern versions
of programs and packages.
TeX is a typesetting system that incorporates a macro
processor. A TeX source document specifies or incorporates a
number of macro definitions that instruct the TeX engine how to
typeset the document. The TeX engine also uses font metrics
generated by Metafont, or by any of several other mechanisms
that incorporate fonts from other sources into an environment
suitable for TeX. TeX has been, and continues, a basis and an
inspiration for several other programs, including e-TeX and
PDFTeX. The distribution includes the source of Knuth's TeX
book; this source is there to read, as an example of writing
TeX -- it should not be processed without Knuth's direct
permission.
This bundle provides a collection of model .ini files for
creating TeX formats. These files are commonly used to
introduced distribution-dependent variations in formats. They
are also used to allow existing format source files to be used
with newer engines, for example to adapt the plain e-TeX source
file to work with XeTeX and LuaTeX.
texconfig allows one to configure and maintain TeX in an easy
and convenient manner, offering a series of dialog boxes to
the user. The directory in which texconfig is found is also
preferentially used to find subprograms.
This package contains the files needed to get the TeX Live
tools (notably tlmgr) running: perl modules, xz binaries, plus
(sometimes) tar and wget.  These files end up in the standalone
install packages, and in the tlcritical repository.
This bundle provides generic access to Unicode Consortium data
for TeX use. It contains a set of text files provided by the
Unicode Consortium which are currently all from Unicode 8.0.0,
with the exception of MathClass.txt which is not currently part
of the Unicode Character Database. Accompanying these source
data are generic TeX loader files allowing this data to be used
as part of TeX runs, in particular in building format files.
Currently there are two loader files: one for general character
set up and one for initialising XeTeX character classes as has
been carried out to date by unicode-letters.tex. The source
data are distributed in accordance with the license stipulated
by the Unicode Consortium. The bundle as a whole is co-
ordinated by the LaTeX3 Project as a general resource for TeX
users.
XeTeX is an extension of TeX that integrates TeX's typesetting capabilities
with (a) the Unicode text encoding standard (supporting most of the world’s
scripts) and (b) modern font technologies (TrueType and OpenType) and text
layout services (AAT, OpenType layout, SIL Graphite) provided by the host
operating system and available libraries.

With XeTeX, the advanced typographic features provided by OpenType fonts become
available for all TeX users, as well as support for complex non-roman scripts.
XeTeX also eliminates the complex task of managing a TeX font installation.
XeTeX is now part of the standard TeX distribution TeXLive and works well with
TeX macro packages like LaTeX and ConTeXt.

Implementation of Double-Array structure for representing trie.","
datrie is an implementation of double-array structure for representing trie.

A password-checking library.
The standard CrackLib dictionaries.","
CrackLib tests passwords to determine whether they match certain
security-oriented characteristics, with the purpose of stopping users
from choosing passwords that are easy to guess. CrackLib performs
several tests on passwords: it tries to generate words from a username
and gecos entry and checks those words against the password; it checks
for simplistic patterns in passwords; and it checks for the password
in a dictionary.

CrackLib is actually a library containing a particular C function
which is used to check the password, as well as other C
functions. CrackLib is not a replacement for a passwd program; it must
be used in conjunction with an existing passwd program.

Install the cracklib package if you need a program to check users'
passwords to see if they are at least minimally secure. If you install
CrackLib, you will also want to install the cracklib-dicts package.
The cracklib-dicts package includes the CrackLib dictionaries.
CrackLib will need to use the dictionary appropriate to your system,
which is normally put in /usr/share/dict/words. Cracklib-dicts also
contains the utilities necessary for the creation of new dictionaries.

xerces-j2,"
Java XML parser.","
Welcome to the future! Xerces2 is the next generation of high performance,
fully compliant XML parsers in the Apache Xerces family. This new version of
Xerces introduces the Xerces Native Interface (XNI), a complete framework for
building parser components and configurations that is extremely modular and
easy to program.

The Apache Xerces2 parser is the reference implementation of XNI but other
parser components, configurations, and parsers can be written using the Xerces
Native Interface. For complete design and implementation documents, refer to
the XNI Manual.

Xerces2 is a fully conforming XML Schema processor. For more information,
refer to the XML Schema page.

Xerces2 also provides a complete implementation of the Document Object Model
Level 3 Core and Load/Save W3C Recommendations and provides a complete
implementation of the XML Inclusions (XInclude) W3C Recommendation. It also
provides support for OASIS XML Catalogs v1.1.

Xerces2 is able to parse documents written according to the XML 1.1
Recommendation, except that it does not yet provide an option to enable
normalization checking as described in section 2.13 of this specification. It
also handles name spaces according to the XML Namespaces 1.1 Recommendation,
and will correctly serialize XML 1.1 documents if the DOM level 3 load/save
APIs are in use.",xml parser java ,xml xerces2 parsers specification namespaces ,java parser ,provide document complete implementation parser ,5,none

BigDecimal provides similar support for very large or very accurate floating
point numbers. Decimal arithmetic is also useful for general calculation,
because it provides the correct answers people expect–whereas normal binary
floating point arithmetic often introduces subtle errors because of the
conversion between base 10 and base 2.

one when you misspelled something.
IO/Console provides very simple and portable access to console. It doesn't
provide higher layer features, such like curses and readline.

Provides telnet client functionality.

This class also has, through delegation, all the methods of a socket object
(by default, a TCPSocket, but can be set by the Proxy option to new()). This
provides methods such as close() to end the session and sysread() to read data
directly from the host, instead of via the waitfor() mechanism. Note that if
you do use sysread() directly when in telnet mode, you should probably pass
the output through preprocess() to extract telnet command sequences.
OpenSSL provides SSL, TLS and general purpose cryptography. It wraps the
OpenSSL library.
Power Assert shows each value of variables and method calls in the expression.
It is useful for testing, providing which value wasn't correct when the

Calling Perl's in-built 'system()' function is easy; determining if it
was successful is _hard_. Let's face it, '$?' isn't the nicest variable
in the world to play with, and even if you _do_ check it, producing a
well-formatted error string takes a lot of work. 'IPC::System::Simple'
takes the hard work out of calling external commands. In fact, if you
want to be really lazy, you can just write:

    use IPC::System::Simple qw(system);

return a zero exit value), or die with rich diagnostic messages.",diagnostics commands run ,perl ipc commands diagnostic successful ,command simply detailed ,command function take work system ,5,应用库

time reading them, you will probably find it useful. The formatting
can be controlled with command line parameters. The default parameter
settings approximately follow the suggestions in the Perl Style Guide.
Perltidy can also output HTML of both POD and source code. Besides
re-formatting scripts, Perltidy can be a great help in tracking down
errors with missing or extra braces, parentheses, and square brackets
because it is very good at localizing errors.",perl indenting scripts ,perl perltidy indents formats scripts ,tool indent re-formatting ,perl script perltidy parameter error ,5,应用库

PCRE2 is a re-working of the original PCRE (Perl-compatible regular

PCRE2 is written in C, and it has its own API. There are three sets of
functions, one for the 8-bit library, which processes strings of bytes, one
for the 16-bit library, which processes strings of 16-bit values, and one for
the 32-bit library, which processes strings of 32-bit values. There are no C++
wrappers. This package provides support for strings in 8-bit and UTF-8
encodings. Install pcre2-utf16 or pcre2-utf32 packages for the other ones.

The distribution does contain a set of C wrapper functions for the 8-bit
library that are based on the POSIX regular expression API (see the pcre2posix
man page). These can be found in a library called libpcre2posix. Note that

This package lets you create and manipulate complex numbers. By default, Perl

nbdkit is a toolkit for creating NBD servers.

The key features are:

* Multithreaded NBD server written in C with good performance.

* Minimal dependencies for the basic server.

* Liberal license (BSD) allows nbdkit to be linked to proprietary
  libraries or included in proprietary code.

* Well-documented, simple plugin API with a stable ABI guarantee.
  Lets you to export ""unconventional"" block devices easily.

* You can write plugins in C or many other languages.

* Filters can be stacked in front of plugins to transform the output.

'nbdkit' is a meta-package which pulls in the core server and a
useful subset of plugins and filters with minimal dependencies.

If you want just the server, install 'nbdkit-server'.

Xdmx is proxy X server that provides multi-head support for multiple displays
attached to different machines (each of which is running a typical X server).
When Xinerama is used with Xdmx, the multiple displays on multiple machines
are presented to the user as a single unified screen.  A simple application
for Xdmx would be to provide multi-head support using two desktop machines,
each of which has a single display device attached to it.  A complex
application for Xdmx would be to unify a 4 by 4 grid of 1280x1024 displays
(each attached to one of 16 computers) into a unified 5120x4096 display.
Xnest is an X server which has been implemented as an ordinary
X application.  It runs in a window just like other X applications,
but it is an X server itself in which you can run other software.  It
is a very useful tool for developers who wish to test their
applications without running them on their real X server.
Xvfb (X Virtual Frame Buffer) is an X server that is able to run on
machines with no display hardware and no physical input devices.
Xvfb simulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual memory.  Xvfb does
not open any devices, but behaves otherwise as an X display.  Xvfb
is normally used for testing servers.

Xnest, Xephyr renders to an X image rather than relaying the

This plugin converts the ALSA API over OSS API.  With this plugin,
ALSA native apps can run on OSS drivers.

This plugin provides the PCM type ""oss"".
This plugin allows any program that uses the ALSA API to access a PulseAudio
sound daemon. In other words, native ALSA applications can play and record
sound across a network. There are two plugins in the suite, one for PCM and
one for mixer control.

Velocity is a Java-based template engine. It permits anyone to use the

Java code.
When Velocity is used for web development, Web designers can work in
parallel with Java programmers to develop web sites according to the
Model-View-Controller (MVC) model, meaning that web page designers can
focus solely on creating a site that looks good, and programmers can
focus solely on writing top-notch code. Velocity separates Java code
from the web pages, making the web site more maintainable over the long
run and providing a viable alternative to Java Server Pages (JSPs) or
PHP.
Velocity's capabilities reach well beyond the realm of web sites; for
example, it can generate SQL and PostScript and XML (see Anakia for more
information on XML transformations) from templates. It can be used
either as a standalone utility for generating source code and reports,
or as an integrated component of other systems. Velocity also provides
template services for the Turbine web application framework.

applications to be developed according to a true MVC model.",template java engine ,velocity jsps templates php framework ,java-based template engine ,site template java code velocity ,7,none

Javadoc for objenesis.
A library for instantiating Java objects.","
This package contains the API documentation for objenesis.
Objenesis is a small Java library that serves one purpose: to instantiate
a new object of a particular class.
Java supports dynamic instantiation of classes using Class.newInstance();
however, this only works if the class has an appropriate constructor. There
are many times when a class cannot be instantiated this way, such as when
the class contains constructors that require arguments, that have side effects,
and/or that throw exceptions. As a result, it is common to see restrictions
in libraries stating that classes must require a default constructor.
Objenesis aims to overcome these restrictions by bypassing the constructor
on object instantiation. Needing to instantiate an object without calling
the constructor is a fairly specialized task, however there are certain cases
when this is useful:
* Serialization, Remoting and Persistence - Objects need to be instantiated
  and restored to a specific state, without invoking code.
* Proxies, AOP Libraries and Mock Objects - Classes can be sub-classed without
  needing to worry about the super() constructor.
* Container Frameworks - Objects can be dynamically instantiated in
  non-standard ways.",javadoc objenesis instantiating ,constructors instantiation objenesis newinstance frameworks ,library instantiate java ,instantiate constructor class objects without ,7,none
munge-maven-plugin,"
Munge Maven Plugin.
API documentation for munge-maven-plugin.","
Munge is a purposely-simple Java preprocessor. It only supports
conditional inclusion of source based on defined strings of the
form ""if[tag]"", ""if_not[tag]"", ""else[tag]"", and ""end[tag]"".
Unlike traditional preprocessors, comments, and formatting are all
preserved for the included lines. This is on purpose, as the output
of Munge will be distributed as human-readable source code.

To avoid creating a separate Java dialect, the conditional tags are
contained in Java comments. This allows one build to compile the
source files without pre-processing, to facilitate faster incremental
development. Other builds from the same source have their code contained
within that comment. The format of the tags is a little verbose, so
that the tags won't accidentally be used by other comment readers
such as javadoc. Munge tags must be in C-style comments;
C++-style comments may be used to comment code within a comment.

Like any preprocessor, developers must be careful not to abuse its
capabilities so that their code becomes unreadable. Please use it
as little as possible.

edit a class file without knowledge of the specifications of the Java
bytecode. The whole API is designed with only the vocabulary of the
Java language. You can even specify inserted bytecode in the form of
source text; Javassist compiles it on the fly. On the other hand, the

The Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is perhaps the most significant

resources via HTTP, it doesn't provide the full flexibility or
functionality needed by many applications. The Jakarta Commons HTTP
Client component seeks to fill this void by providing an efficient,

most recent HTTP standards and recommendations.

Lightweight dependency injection framework for Java 5 and above.","
Put simply, Guice alleviates the need for factories and the use of new

depend directly on them. Your code will be easier to change, unit test
and reuse in other contexts.

Guice embraces Java's type safe nature, especially when it comes to
features introduced in Java 5 such as generics and annotations. You
might think of Guice as filling in missing features for core
Java. Ideally, the language itself would provide most of the same
features, but until such a language comes along, we have Guice.

Guice helps you design better APIs, and the Guice API itself sets a
good example. Guice is not a kitchen sink. We justify each feature
with at least three use cases. When in doubt, we leave it out. We
build general functionality which enables you to extend Guice rather
than adding every feature to the core framework.",dependency java injection ,guice java apis annotations factories ,lightweight dependency injection ,guice feature java code come ,7,none

The Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) allows developers to build tools and
other applications based on a structured data model. From a model
specification described in XMI, EMF provides tools and run-time support to
produce a set of Java classes for the model, along with a set of adapter
classes that enable viewing and command-based editing of the model, and a
basic editor.
The XML Schema Definition (XSD) plug-in is a library that provides an API for
manipulating the components of an XML Schema as described by the W3C XML
Schema specifications, as well as an API for manipulating the DOM-accessible
representation of XML Schema as a series of XML documents.

paths, such as the execution root directory, the directory for a specific
project in the current build session, or the highest project base directory
(closest to the filesystem root directory) available in the projects loaded
from disk (not resolved from a remote repository). The plugin will then reflect
this value to the console, and also inject it into each project's properties

parsing, interactive command parsing, and file reading. Many
megabytes of YACC code have been written over the years.
This is the standard YACC tool that is in use every day to produce

Bean Scripting Framework.","
Javadoc for bsf.
Bean Scripting Framework (BSF) is a set of Java classes which provides
scripting language support within Java applications, and access to Java
objects and methods from scripting languages. BSF allows one to write
JSPs in languages other than Java while providing access to the Java
class library. In addition, BSF permits any Java application to be
implemented in part (or dynamically extended) by a language that is
embedded within it. This is achieved by providing an API that permits
calling scripting language engines from within Java, as well as an
object registry that exposes Java objects to these scripting language
engines.

BSF supports several scripting languages currently:
* Javascript (using Rhino ECMAScript, from the Mozilla project)
* Python (using either Jython or JPython)
* Tcl (using Jacl)
* NetRexx (an extension of the IBM REXX scripting language in Java)
* XSLT Stylesheets (as a component of Apache XML project's Xalan and
Xerces)

In addition, the following languages are supported with their own BSF
engines:
* Java (using BeanShell, from the BeanShell project)
* JRuby
* JudoScript",javadoc bsf bean ,javadoc jsps bsf beanshell scripting ,bean scripting framework ,java language script project provide ,7,none

Lightweight Scripting for Java.
API documentation for bsh.
Manual for bsh.","
BeanShell is a small, free, embeddable, Java source interpreter with
object scripting language features, written in Java. BeanShell
executes standard Java statements and expressions, in addition to
obvious scripting commands and syntax. BeanShell supports scripted
objects as simple method closures like those in Perl and
JavaScript(tm). You can use BeanShell interactively for Java
experimentation and debugging or as a simple scripting engine for your
applications. In short: BeanShell is a dynamically interpreted Java,
plus some useful stuff. Another way to describe it is to say that in
many ways BeanShell is to Java as Tcl/Tk is to C: BeanShell is
embeddable - You can call BeanShell from your Java applications to
execute Java code dynamically at run-time or to provide scripting
extensibility for your applications. Alternatively, you can call your
Java applications and objects from BeanShell; working with Java
objects and APIs dynamically. Since BeanShell is written in Java and
runs in the same space as your application, you can freely pass
references to ""real live"" objects into scripts and return them as
results.

RPM macros for building RPMs with Python 3.6.

python36-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The bytecode format is unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between
this and the standard version of Python, but the debugging features mean that
C/C++ extension modules are ABI-incompatible and must be built for each version
separately.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime, so that .py and .pyc files can be shared.
Compiled extension modules use a special ABI flag (""d"") in the filename,
so extensions for both verisons can co-exist in the same directory.

interpreter for the Python language, version 3.

using the ""alternatives --config python3"" command.

python38-debug provides a version of the Python runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues and other bugs.

The debug build shares installation directories with the standard Python
runtime. Python modules -- source (.py), bytecode (.pyc), and C-API extensions
(.cpython*.so) -- are compatible between this and the standard version
of Python.

The debug runtime additionally supports debug builds of C-API extensions
(with the ""d"" ABI flag) for debugging issues in those extensions.

python2-debug provides a version of the Python 2 runtime with numerous debugging
features enabled, aimed at advanced Python users, such as developers of Python
extension modules.

This version uses more memory and will be slower than the regular Python 2 build,
but is useful for tracking down reference-counting issues, and other bugs.

The bytecodes are unchanged, so that .pyc files are compatible between the two
version of Python 2, but the debugging features mean that C/C++ extension modules
are ABI-incompatible with those built for the standard runtime.

It shares installation directories with the standard Python 2 runtime, so that
.py and .pyc files can be shared.  All compiled extension modules gain a ""_d""
suffix (""foo_d.so"" rather than ""foo.so"") so that each Python 2 implementation can
load its own extensions.
This package contains files used to embed Python 2 into applications.
This package includes several tools to help with the development of Python 2
programs, including IDLE (an IDE with editing and debugging facilities), a
color editor (pynche), and a python gettext program (pygettext.py).
Python 2 is an old version of the language that is incompatible with the 3.x
line of releases. The language is mostly the same, but many details, especially
how built-in objects like dictionaries and strings work, have changed
considerably, and a lot of deprecated features have finally been removed in the
3.x line.

Note that documentation for Python 2 is provided in the python2-docs

The Certificate Authority (CA) is a required PKI subsystem which issues,
renews, revokes, and publishes certificates as well as compiling and
publishing Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs).

The Certificate Authority can be configured as a self-signing Certificate
Authority, where it is the root CA, or it can act as a subordinate CA,
where it obtains its own signing certificate from a public CA.
The Key Recovery Authority (KRA) is an optional PKI subsystem that can act
as a key archival facility.  When configured in conjunction with the
Certificate Authority (CA), the KRA stores private encryption keys as part of
the certificate enrollment process.  The key archival mechanism is triggered
when a user enrolls in the PKI and creates the certificate request.  Using the
Certificate Request Message Format (CRMF) request format, a request is
generated for the user's private encryption key.  This key is then stored in
the KRA which is configured to store keys in an encrypted format that can only
be decrypted by several agents requesting the key at one time, providing for
protection of the public encryption keys for the users in the PKI deployment.

Note that the KRA archives encryption keys; it does NOT archive signing keys,
since such archival would undermine non-repudiation properties of signing keys.

The daxio utility performs I/O on Device DAX devices or zero
a Device DAX device.  Since the standard I/O APIs (read/write) cannot be used
with Device DAX, data transfer is performed on a memory-mapped device.
The daxio may be used to dump Device DAX data to a file, restore data from
a backup copy, move/copy data to another device or to erase data from
a device.
The pmempool is a standalone utility for management and off-line analysis
of Persistent Memory pools created by PMDK libraries. It provides a set
of utilities for administration and diagnostics of Persistent Memory pools.
The pmempool may be useful for troubleshooting by system administrators
and users of the applications based on PMDK libraries.
The pmreorder tool is a collection of python scripts designed to parse
and replay operations logged by pmemcheck - a persistent memory checking tool.
Pmreorder performs the store reordering between persistent memory barriers -
a sequence of flush-fence operations. It uses a consistency checking routine
provided in the command line options to check whether files are in a consistent state.
The rpmemd process is executed on a target node by librpmem library
and facilitates access to persistent memory over RDMA.
The libpmem provides low level persistent memory support. In particular,
support for the persistent memory instructions for flushing changes
to pmem is provided.
The libpmemblk implements a pmem-resident array of blocks, all the same
size, where a block is updated atomically with respect to power
failure or program interruption (no torn blocks).
The libpmemlog library provides a pmem-resident log file. This is
useful for programs like databases that append frequently to a log
file.
The libpmemobj library provides a transactional object store,
providing memory allocation, transactions, and general facilities for
persistent memory programming.
The libpmempool library provides a set of utilities for off-line
administration, analysis, diagnostics and repair of persistent memory
pools created by libpmemlog, libpemblk and libpmemobj libraries.
The librpmem library provides low-level support for remote access
to persistent memory utilizing RDMA-capable NICs. It can be used
to replicate persistent memory regions over RDMA protocol.
The libvmem library turns a pool of persistent memory into a volatile
memory pool, similar to the system heap but kept separate and with
its own malloc-style API.
The libvmmalloc library transparently converts all the dynamic memory
allocations into persistent memory allocations. This allows the use
of persistent memory as volatile memory without modifying the target
application.

  for empty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support
  for ambiguous grammars.
* PLY is straightforward to use and provides very extensive error checking.

xmlstreambuffer,"
XML Stream Buffer.","
A stream buffer is a stream-based representation of an XML
info-set in Java. Stream buffers are designed to: provide
very efficient stream-based memory representations of XML
info-sets; and be created and processed using any Java-based
XML API.
Conceptually a stream buffer is similar to the representation
used in the Xerces deferred DOM implementation, with the crucial
difference that a stream buffer does not store hierarchical
information like parent and sibling information. The deferred
DOM implementation reduces memory usage when large XML documents
are parsed but only a subset of the document needs to be processed.
(Note that using deferred DOM will be more expensive than
non-deferred DOM in terms of memory and processing if all
the document is traversed.)
Stream buffers may be used as an efficient alternative to DOM where:
* most or all of an XML info-set will eventually get traversed; and/or
* targeted access to certain parts of an XML info-set are required
 and need to be efficiently processed using stream-based APIs like
 SAX or StAX.",xml buffer stream ,buffers xml stream java deferred ,stream buffer ,buffer memory stream-based representation stream ,10,none

Conversion between markup formats.
Pandoc data files.","
Pandoc is a Haskell library for converting from one markup format to another,
and a command-line tool that uses this library. It can read several dialects of
Markdown and (subsets of) HTML, reStructuredText, LaTeX, DocBook, JATS,
MediaWiki markup, TWiki markup, TikiWiki markup, Creole 1.0, Haddock markup,
OPML, Emacs Org-Mode, Emacs Muse, txt2tags, Vimwiki, Word Docx, ODT, and
Textile, and it can write Markdown, reStructuredText, XHTML, HTML 5, LaTeX,
ConTeXt, DocBook, JATS, OPML, TEI, OpenDocument, ODT, Word docx, RTF,
MediaWiki, DokuWiki, ZimWiki, Textile, groff man, groff ms, plain text, Emacs

ICML, Muse, LaTeX beamer slides, PowerPoint, and several kinds of
HTML/JavaScript slide shows (S5, Slidy, Slideous, DZSlides, reveal.js).

In contrast to most existing tools for converting Markdown to HTML, pandoc has
a modular design: it consists of a set of readers, which parse text in a given
format and produce a native representation of the document, and a set of
writers, which convert this native representation into a target format.
Thus, adding an input or output format requires only adding a reader or writer.

For pdf output please also install pandoc-pdf.

tape, or a pipe.  GNU cpio supports the following archive formats:  binary,
old ASCII, new ASCII, crc, HPUX binary, HPUX old ASCII, old tar and POSIX.1
tar.  By default, cpio creates binary format archives, so that they are
compatible with older cpio programs.  When it is extracting files from
archives, cpio automatically recognizes which kind of archive it is reading

Library to enable creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems.

Libisoburn is a front-end for libraries libburn and libisofs which
enables creation and expansion of ISO-9660 filesystems on all CD/
DVD/BD media supported by libburn. This includes media like DVD+RW,
which do not support multi-session management on media level and
even plain disk files or block devices. Price for that is thorough
specialization on data files in ISO-9660 filesystem images. And so
libisoburn is not suitable for audio (CD-DA) or any other CD layout
which does not entirely consist of ISO-9660 sessions.
Xorriso is a program which copies file objects from POSIX compliant
filesystems into Rock Ridge enhanced ISO-9660 filesystems and allows
session-wise manipulation of such filesystems. It can load management
information of existing ISO images and it writes the session results
to optical media or to filesystem objects. Vice versa xorriso is able
to copy file objects out of ISO-9660 filesystems.

Filesystem manipulation capabilities surpass those of mkisofs. Xorriso
is especially suitable for backups, because of its high fidelity of
file attribute recording and its incremental update sessions. Optical
